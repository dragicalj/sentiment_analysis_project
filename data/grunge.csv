Blew,"And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to lose
And if you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to lose
And if you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything"
Floyd The Barber,"Bell on door clangs, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face
I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
I sense others in the room
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Aunt Bee's muff
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed"
About A Girl,"I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free (I do)
I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free
I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No, I can't see you every night
Free
I do

Love Buzz,"Would you believe me when I tell you
You're the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Would you believe me when I tell you
You're the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you

Paper Cuts,"At my feeding time
She'd push food through the door
I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down
The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twitch and masturbate
Why?
I said so
I said so
I said so
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Black windows of paint
I scratch with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point at my way
They come with their flashing lights
And take my family away
And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you
To take
Me with
Your life

Swap Meet,"They live a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make a living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they would come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart

Mr. Moustache,"Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision

(New Wave) Polly,"Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
Maybe she wants some water
To put out the blow torch
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, heaven true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
Asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself

Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself

Beeswax,"I was a seeking out for a funnel
Not only magnets but I could pry bar it shut
Gluing my manhood towards a manhole
Like Pepe LePew the scent
Hey, hey, a lightweight clutch
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titillate
(Hydraulic push of) kitty ass button
Tweeking and flexing if the wind blows just right
Tacky and thumbs on polyester
High water jumpsuits and a raped ape
Woody has pix-n-facts
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate
I don't know why
I've got a joke too silly to say
Don't trust the foams
I got a dick, dick, hear my fucking hate!
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate
Vinegar and water is gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulation disguised as cotton candy
Spawning down stream, El Rancho Ovulate
Feeding a cow hamburger raw
Peter brought me a tiki idol
Billy's sneer reminds me of someone
Homesick a bay aboard the Love Boat
Toni Tenille, Sonny Bono
Charo had a nice set of lungs
I got my penis spayed
I got a little tail
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a heh-heh well you can't live

Mexican Seafood,"Ah, the itchy flakes, it is inflaming
To the gels and creams, it is pertaining
To a fungus mold is my injection
Hope it's only a, a yeast infection
Only hurts when I
Hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I
Hurts when I sing
Now I vomit cum and diarrhea
On the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
With a toilet bowl full of a cloudy pus
I feel my blood becoming chowder rust
Only hurts when I
Hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I
Hurts when I sing
Roll into my bed, which does consist of
Lice, bugs, and fleas, and yellow mucus
Stained dirt Vaseline, toe jam and booger
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge"

Aero Zeppelin,"What's a season in a right, if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme, if a plan means anything?
What's the meaning in a crime? It's a fan if anything
Where's the meaning in a line? It's a brand, it's a brand
How a culture comes again, it's a plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
They're only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans
They'll be fans, they'll be fans
They'll be fans
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly!
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways!

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle,"It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
In her false witness, hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
It's so relieving to know that you're leaving

In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home

What else should I be? All apologies
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
I wish I was like you, easily amused
Find my nest to salt, everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn, choking on the ashes of her enemy
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
Married, buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

The One You Know,"I'm a little alike you before, things had changed
Inner compass aligned, all this feels rearranged
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An imposter, I'm not the one you know
I look the same outside
Nearly me, even though
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An imposter, soldiers on
Are you surprised
Black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
Lay me out with flowered guilt
Watch the explosions falling
Cannot live within this tilt
Carrying over
I'm not the one you know
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An imposter, soldiers on
Are you surprised
Black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
I'm not the one you know"
Rainier Fog,"Some things last, sometimes you never get over
Live in the past, you find out it's hard to stay sober
My see-through skin like Eurythane
Lost and then found, on view for all and I wouldn't trade
You'd never know a long time ago you were frowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know
It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog
Some people change, sometimes you leave how it oughta be
Find a new way to come clean, let it wash over me
My see-through heart like Eurythane
Beats for you proud, up down and through all the love and pain
You'd never know a long time ago you were crowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know
It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog
Left me here so all alone, only for me to find
Hear your voice on waves we rode, echoes inside my mind
Disembodied just a trace of what it was like then
With you here we shared a space that's always half empty
Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty
Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty
So we can laugh it's inside, never hear me complain
My see-through city of cellophane
You'd never know a long time ago you were drowning
Thinking it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know
It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog
Reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog"
Red Giant,"I play the clown for you
Entertaining, absurd hue
And I watch them laugh, I'd love to
See them clap and dance to my tune
Blowing up like a red giant, expansive, a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over
Amen
I act on stage up here
Toying with your own fears
Misdirection I'm so near
Simple sleight of hand, in the clear
Blowing up like a red giant, expansive, a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over
Amen
Too late now, show's over
Real life is much closer
Take the makeup off, you wonder
Why I look the same, only bolder
Blowing up like a red giant, expansive, a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over
Amen
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over
Amen"
Fly,"Led out on a leash behind you, holding ground
And I don't need no reminding, I've been around
Been around, yeah, I am a sound, yeah
Lie down with your peace where you find it
Won't come cheap
Fill up on love when you're hungry, tired then sleep
Have your dreams
Don't let it wind you, let it bring you down
I hate to tell you how little I have found
They paved the road with fool's gold
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm when there ain't no place to hide
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly
Follow where it leads, your heart will know what's true
Don't be blinded by shiny pretty things well past due
It's on you, yeah, it's on you, yeah
Don't let it wind you, let it bring you down
I hate to tell you how little I have found
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm when there ain't no place to hide
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly
They paved the road with fool's gold
They paved the road with fool's gold"
Drone,"In my eyes you are beautiful
Not just right, perfect spiritual
I did what I had to do to get higher
Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers
Not quite dark, not quite light
Steppin' in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
And though you find me rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my pet black hole
In the time I have spent with you
Unconfined, beyond physical
I did not regret my time on the wire
Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers
Not quite dark, not quite light
Steppin' in and out of madness
Such a busy bee, a drone
And though you find me rather tragic
I bear the cost, can't dull my anger
And that's fine
Built up inside, obscuring danger
It's alive
In my eyes you are beautiful
Not just right, perfect spiritual
I did what I had to do to get higher
Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers
Not quite dark, not quite light
Steppin' in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
And though you find me rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my pet black hole
Pet black hole
Pet black hole
Pet black hole
So beautiful"
Deaf Ears Blind Eyes,"Sinking below view
Time's been a wastin'
Alone in a full room
Nobody plays in
I own everything
Whine all set on eleven
I own everything
Cries a soul on fire
Hurt does surround you
Blinded and tied on
Numbness engulfs truth
Let bygones be bygones
I own everything
Whine all set on eleven
I own everything
Cries a soul on fire
And it tears me in a way
Hangin' over
And I feel it's here to stay
Inner coldness so ingrained
Feel like a fake thing
Where did the time go?
Memories worth making
Pass by the window
I own everything
Whine all set on eleven
I own everything
Cries a soul on fire
Soul on fire"
Maybe,"Long gone the days of summer
In L.A. it stretches longer
Fading, waiting
Try to heal but the pain it won't go
Start with less always seems to cost more
Hating, breaking
Remember, come December
One day can last forever
Ain't nowhere that's safe for a lowly pretender
I'm shooting straight for the target center
Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah
Maybe I should go
Got no desire to watch the last tear fall
Maybe this will show
I'm reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah
Maybe I don't know
You anymore and I'm smiling
Our burden is untied
Let it die
I'd be lying if I said it felt right
Even though I got a dog in this fight
Wounded, losing
People talk, in and out the words go
To be the one from where the wind it does blow
Hounded, surrounded
Remember, come December
One life can live forever
Ain't nowhere that's safe for a lowly pretender
I'm shooting straight for the target center
Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah
Maybe I should go
Got no desire to watch the last tear fall
Maybe this will show
I'm reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah
Maybe I don't know
You anymore and I'm smiling

So Far Under,"I survive on the scraps you don't burn
Maybe love's something I'll never learn
This whole house of cards crumbling slow
If I disappear, would you even know?
The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive
The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive
So far under hell
Fought hard where I fell
Now forever dwell
So far under
So far under hell
Too much pain to tell
And now I'm ripped asunder
So far under
All my words sucked straight into the void
Same black hole where my heart was destroyed
The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive
The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive
So far under hell
Fought hard where I fell
Now forever dwell
So far under
So far under hell
Too much pain to tell
And now I'm ripped asunder
So far under
So far under hell
Fought hard where I fell
Now forever dwell
So far under
So far under hell
Too much pain to tell
And now I'm ripped asunder
So far under"
Never Fade,"Silent grief suffocates the room
I feel my breathing speed up at the thought of you
My inner voice seems to want me dead
Only choice to vanish down the trail I bled
You're never far away, I always see you
And when it all goes dark you light my way through
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
Growing cold, try to numb my feeling
Lose control, all my friends are leaving
Paid the price for all the lives I used to live
Sacrifice for all the love I try to give
You're never far away, I always see you
And when it all goes dark you light my way through
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
Never fade
Never fade"
All I Am,"Cannot recognize the face before me
It's unfamiliar
Time has left me, broken down and homely
Can you still see me, I'm disguised?
Outside the window of your life
Clinging to the memory of your pride
After many years the road you wandered
Left me here alone deprived of others
On your toes or on your heels
There's a line drawn the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shine
Have another go my friend, you see I can't feel anymore
While you question just who the hell am I
Is this all I am?
Given all I can?
Is this all I am?
'Til the end of time
Never knowing why
Ghosts and damage, no advantage for me
I'm past believing
Understand the price you pay, disarming
When you can leave it all behind
Outside the window of your eyes
Clinging to the memory of your prime
After many years the road you wandered
Left me here alone deprived of others
On your toes or on your heels
There's a hole worn the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shine
Have another go my friend, you see I can't feel anymore
While you question just who the hell am I
Is this all I am?
Given all I can
Is this all I am?
'Til the end of time
Never knowing why
Cannot recognize the face before me
It's unfamiliar"
Hollow,"Come to me, I′ll fill the hole
Why would I be lying?

Peace of mind worth buying
Bow down last round up

Pretty Done,"So you got the thing you wanted
Don't let it go
Though it hurts your hand to hold it
Don't let it show
I'm pretty done
Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun
Finding no pleasant changes
In old enemies
Not a lead a bit part playing
In my story
I'm pretty done
Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun
I don't care to further amuse you
Never had you how, could I lose you?
Paid in full, I owe no one at all
I'm supposed to smile and ignore it
Better than some
High roads are to fall from
Already hung
I'm pretty done
Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun
Pushing towards hopeless mission
Curiosity, omission
History colored since the fall
I'm pretty done
I'm pretty done
I'm pretty done
I'm pretty done"
Stone,"I know you think I’m wrong but I’m not your tour guide
Have a guess, I don’t let you look inside
Cold dry stone
What makes you want to carve your initials in me?
Rained and weathered, erasing, hard to read
Find me distant, outwardly rough, obscene
Cold dry stone
Cold and dry a stone
Cold and dry a stone
I’m not a cornerstone in a palace for you
Time will bring your very own hard truth
Not to worry, ice covered rocks still move
Cold dry stone
Cold dry stone"
Voices,"Who am I, is this me?
Am I one or thirteen?
I've gone cold, hard to deal
Used to stand where I kneel
Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
I want more, than I need
I don't know what is real
Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Whispering of names, faces
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone
Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems
I've been told dreaming's free
Think I'll go back to sleep
Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Calling out the names, faces
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone
Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems"

Lab Monkey,"Anybody out there?
Anyone at all?
Can you finally hear this deep in
Scratching through the wall?
Came far to find me...
Down the rabbit hole...
Watch me smiling back while
Chewing on my skull
I know...
Wont forget...
Limped away
From the wreck
Is the monkey breathing?
Lookin' kinda sick...
Got a witty comment for me?
Have yourself a kick!
Does it make you feel good?
Are you full and strong?
Gonna end up in this cage and
I hope your stay is long
I know...
Wont forget...
Limped away

We'll never know what this is
'Til we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies
We'll never know what this is
'Til we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before
Had enough - I don't need you to stick my hide
Had enough - no more tears for me left to cry
Had enough - I don't need you to blind my eyes
Had enough - no more tears for me left to cry
I know
Wont forget

Low Ceiling,"Old mister fun is back
Wonder where he's been hiding at
Hanging round the edge
Walls unfortified, inside
No different, patchwork hack
Toil away on an unlaid track
Falls closing in, got nowhere to hide
This time
Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor
Past twisted, expected wrap
Attention span increasingly short
Hard to breathe, this altitude will get you high
I've tried
Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor
And nobody can tell you
It's a moment in time
That defines and deforms you
Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor
And nobody can tell you
It's your moment in time
Write me over, false reporter
Can't you let me shine
Write me over, false reporter
Can't you let me shine
And nobody can tell you
It's a moment in time
That defines and deforms you"
Breath on a Window,"Mending fence along the road
Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs holed
Keep ahead of the weather
Long past time to close dead eyes
Find a break in the highway
Out here I'm invisible
Very few going my way
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home
Ghost town strip of misery
I ain't feeling no better
Road kill heart inside of me
Follow it to the letter
Sundown brings a welcome change
Everything that's hiding
More at home in landscapes strange
Are you selling I'm buying
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rearview reflecting there ain't nobody home
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul
Connect the dot scribbling
And you would never know
Failed to head the signal
Thought you got through just in time
Crashing hard upon your ego
Penetrated from the side
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday."
Scalpel,"Road narrows, pouring down
I'm breaking without a sound
Bits and pieces of trying
Get what you pay for, nothing
Frozen dreaming of yesterday
Potent, creeping I'm far away
From my hometown I lit out
To save my skin and shed some doubt
I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before
It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself
Hard as truth is, been my friend
Don't need to be invited in
I'll go round 'til bested
Pick up myself and try again
I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before
It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself
All comes in time
Don't fight it, don't mind it
Whatever may come
I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down both roads before
It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself"
Phantom Limb,"No hope of rescue
I'm trapped here alone
If I don't dig my own way out I'll die here
Gave my loyalty too soon
Now the forked-tongue piper's bill is due
Weather is shifting
So cold going numb
Through a pinhole of light, I see vultures circling
Bottom feeders pick my skin
Weathered brain a parasite within
Ego pulverized
No better medicine
Angels have been advised
Don't want no requiem
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb
Gonna wear you like a second skin
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb...
Yeah...
Every new second
Getting harder to breathe
No matter which side I end up on, this ain't over
My regrets are many true
Still so much worse lies ahead for you
Ego pulverized
No better medicine
Angels have been advised
Don't want no requiem
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb
Gonna wear you like a second skin
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb..."
Hung on a Hook,"Hung on a hook I'm a mirror
Cracked down the center I split you
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes
Show you the face of a man who
Not that he wants but he has to
Look at the thing he's become, what I see
I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change
Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head
Pieces of me on a tile floor
Look up at you as you change more
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times
Hold a reflection inside me
I cannot feel you are empty
Throw me away
I am broken not your time
I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change
Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head
Not gonna save you
Perform euthanasia"
Choke,"Before you ask for something better
You should know I'm practiced at goodbyes
Are you so deprived
Think you're doing me a favor
I don't need no lesser savior
I'm doing fine
Fragile things so close together
Taped up broken from before
Part of something or all of nothing
A very long hard way to fall
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone
Needless tension, the walls around you
Built before you came to tear them down
It was you I found
Take some time to think it over
If it's so hard to walk this road we mind
Then it's time to say goodbye
Fragile things so close together
Taped up broken from before
Part of something or all of nothing
A very long hard way to fall
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone
So go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone
If you don't feel right
Living in our home
Eat your pride alone"
All Secrets Known,"Hope, a new beginning
Time, time to start living life
Like just before we died
There's no going back to the place we started from
Hurts, falling through fingers
Trust, trust in the feeling
There's something left inside
There's no going back to the place we started from
All secrets known
Calm, all wounds are healing
Strong, truth is worth saving
I want to feel alive
There's no going back to the place we started from
All secrets known"
Check My Brain,"And so I found myself in the sun, oh yeah…
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah…
California, I'm fine,
Somebody check my brain
California's alright,
Somebody check my brain
I walked these streets a creep in a fog, oh yeah…
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah…
California, I'm fine,
Somebody check my brain
California's alright,
Somebody check my brain
Tears that filled my bong…
Years expended gone…
I hung my guns and put 'em away, oh yeah…
A trick of the trade and by the way, oh yeah…
California, I'm fine,
Somebody check my brain
California's alright,
Somebody check my brain
Tears that filled my bong,
Years expended gone.
Tears that filled my bong,
Years expended gone."
Last of My Kind,"So young, so brazen, so unholy
I come to you in painted skies
Your broken saint, your ancient story
The living challenge to their lies
Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
And they want to force my hand
Until I take what I wanted
And break all the lies
And defeat the fucking liars
Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen
I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law
A wolf alone upon the hillside
I live on what they throw away
I go to sleep behind the eight ball
I live to fight for one more day
I'm trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
And they want to force my hand
Until I take what I wanted
And break all the lies
And defeat the fucking liars
Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen
Take what I wanted
And break all the lies
And defeat the fucking liars
Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen
I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law
I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law
The last of my kind still standing
The last of my kind still standing"
Your Decision,"Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your god
It's your decision
It's your decision
Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over
It might seem an afterthought
Yes, it hurts to you know you're bought
It's your decision
It's your decision
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
It's your decision
It's your decision
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over"
A Looking in View,"Hear footsteps creak the floor
The shadows give away
Someone outside the door
Wont let them in
Life damaged, gears to grind
A run-down broke machine
That steals your peace of mind
Before you know it's gone
Lay down
Lay
Silence burning, hold your tongue
Keep us separate, sullen, dumb
Hiding in a darkness under
Boiling to the surface, stumble, fall
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense to the low life lie
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense to the low life lie
These things I hate in you
Also reflect it seems
Distortion laced with spite
Takes you out of me
Lay down
Lay
Hiding in a darkness under
Boiling to the surface something
Crawling on your skin, discomfort
Makes you break and run, stumble, fall
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense to the low life lie
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense to the low life lie
It's why you never tell me (heaven's on your mind)
It's why you never tell me (heaven's on your mind)
It's why you never tell me (heaven's on your mind)
It's why you never tell me (heaven's on your mind)

When the Sun Rose Again,"Run, run 'til you drop
Hide, everyone knows
We all trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score
Prey, sqeal when you're caught
Cry, it's not my fault
Time to trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score
It seems you prophesized
All of this would end
Were you burned away
When the sun rose again?
Hate, long wearing thin
Negative, all you've been
Time to trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score
It seems you prophesized
All of this would end
Were you burned away
When the sun rose again?"
Acid Bubble,"You tried to kill me off
Surprised I remain
A scale tips impossible
Afraid of my own name
And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows and know
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner
Alone inside your mind
Intend obsolescence
Built into the system
I tried to shake it off
You can't remove this stain
A scale breaks impossible
Affraid we are the same
And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows and know
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner
Alone inside your mind
Hides in a corner
Dies in a corner
Alone inside your mind
Intend obsolescence
Built into the system"
Lesson Learned,"He broke my heart,
And now it's raining just to rub it in.
I'm at your door,
I feel so crazy about it.
You say, ""I told you so.""
You saw it long ago,
You knew he had to go.
I finally came around,
I'm back on solid ground.
Can't let it get me down.
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright.
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright.
Yes, I was burned but I call it a lesson learned.
The stake will be turned,
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul was returned,
So I call it a lesson learned.
Another lesson learned.
Sometimes some flies can take a minute to fully realize.
His tears,
Your eyes,
Thirty seconds to apologize.
You give it one more chance,
Just like the time before.
But he already know,
You'd give a hundred more.
Until that night in bed,
You wake up in a sweat,
You're racing to the door,
Can't take it anymore.
I was burned, but I call it a lesson learned.
The stake will be turned so I call it a lesson learned.
My soul has returned, so I call it a lesson learned.
Another lesson learned.
Life perfect ain't perfect if you don't know what the struggle's fore.
Falling down ain't falling down if you don't cry when you hit the floor.
It's called the past, cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before.
You ought to see me now.
Yes, I was burned but I call it a lesson learned.
The stake will be turned so I call it a lesson learned.
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned."
Take Her Out,"Here I am again
I feel time is dragging on
Aren't you getting tired of me?
Whinging overdrawn
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
In a bodiless embrace
Thriving, I have grown
Fickle, changing, grip replaced
Choking, take it all
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
Dedicated, true to form
Still the only one
Only guarantee
Continue after I am done
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again"

Consciously avoiding changes
Curtains drawn now its done

Not to plan my funeral before the body dies, yeah
Come the morning light, it's a see through show
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah

Let me sleep so my teeth don't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside
Sure to play a part, so you love the game
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah
I could set you free, rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah
Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth don't grind

Brush Away,"I could use some time to curl away
My aggression is where you stake your claim
Why I question this curve on which you grade
My conception, a joke or latest craze?
I try to get away, and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground
My intention, may I arrive at eight?
Lie and dream some, surprise you guys I'm late
All right, correction, forgetting something, wait
I try to get away, and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground
Brush away loose ground
Brush away"
Sludge Factory,"You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake, and I'm high?
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
20 hours won't print my picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size
Call me up congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day 9
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
By the way, by the way, by the way
Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me
Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past 25
I say stay long enough to repay all who cause strife
Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me

Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

Then I heard a voice
Said ""Son you have a choice""
I then slapped my face

And it washed me so far away
I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stare at me so hollow
Got to keep that killin' pace
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away
I burned the place around you
I hit you with a rake

Rain When I Die,"Is she ready to know my frustration?
What she slippin' inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me
Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
When I die
Was it something I said, held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me
She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry
Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me
Prob'ly not, I know why, can't explain me
Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
When I die"
Down In A Hole,"Bury me softly in this womb

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they
Thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now a man
Who won't let himself be
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
I'd like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied
Down in a hole and they've put all
The stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue
Has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty
Of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more
of my feelings beneath
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
Bury me softly in this womb
Oh I want to be inside of you
I give this part of me for you
Oh I want to be inside of you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers (Oh I want to be inside of you)
In a tomb...in bloom
Oh I want to be inside...
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, outta control

Sickman,"What the hell am I?
Thousand eyes, a fly
Lucky then I'd be
In one day deceased

When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine
What the hell am I?
Leper from inside
Inside wall of peace
Dirty and diseased
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman
I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine
Can you see the end?
Choke on me my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

""Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert
I tread on a plane of many
We who are of good nature and intention,
But cannot touch on the dark
Recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk
With me, feel the pain,
And release it...""
What the hell am I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened 10 miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die

Rooster,"Ain't found a way to kill me yet

You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, ya know he ain't gonna die

Nothing better than a dealer who's high
Be high, convince them to buy
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills
But we are an elite race of our own
The stoners, junkies, and freaks
Are you happy? I am, man.
Content and fully aware
Money, status, nothing to me
'Cause your life is empty and bare
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
I do it a lot, yeah
You can't understand a user's mind
But try, with your books and degrees
If you let yourself go and opened your mind
I'll bet you'd be doing like me
And it ain't so bad
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot

I do it a lot!

Dirt,"I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self control

For me
I want to taste dirty, stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me
You, you are so special
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me"

Straw that broke your back, you're under

To the lie, and you think I don't find what you hide?
What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
For the horse you've grown much fonder
Than for me, that I don't ponder
As the hair of one who bit you
Smiling bite your own self, too
And I think that you're not blind
To the ones you left behind
I'll be here
What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
So be yearning all your life
Twisting, turning like a knife
Now you know the reasons why
Can't get high, or you will die
Or you'll die
What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
So your sickness weighs a ton
And God's name is smack for some"

Hate To Feel,"What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate
What the fuck will it take
Drown myself in my wake
Another shaggy D.A.
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Gotta change, set a date
Eat my cake, lick my plate
Stare at me with empty eyes and
Point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you
What you're scared to see

I can feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see - (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
So climb walls,
Thin my blood now
And I crawl, back to bed now
What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance
All this time I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face
Exactly what I am

Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better

Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

Sea Of Sorrow,"Mind, of destructive taste

That was your heart
Lost in the dark
Call off the chase
Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time...
I think of you
Oh, yes I do
Such a crime
You opened fire...and your mark was true
You opened fire...aim my smilin' skull at you
You opened fire...
I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace
I'll never know
How far to go
To reach that place
You opened fire...and your mark was true
You opened fire...aim my smilin' skull at you
You opened fire...
I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow"

How you all would bleed for me
If you scorn my lover
Satan got your thigh
If you steal in hunger
I will kick you when you try

I like to see
How you all would bleed for me

'Scuse the 'tude but I haven't eaten today

Feel the pain and keep it all in till you die
Without eyes you cannot cry
Who's to blame?
I can't remember... I can't...
Remember identity, the visions in my mind from
Screamin' at me
And mama, mama, ooh...my angry brains of infancy
Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe
down your throat and steal your energy
You took everything but my will to be
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed

"Love, Hate, Love","I tried to love you I thought I could
I tried to own you I thought I would
I want to peel the skin from your face
Before the real you lays to waste
You told me I'm the only one
Sweet little angel you should have run
Lying, crying, dying to leave
Innocence creates my hell
Cheating myself still you know more
It would be so easy with a whore
Try to understand me little girl
My twisted passion to be your world
Lost inside my sick head
I live for you but I'm not alive
Take my hand before I kill
I still love you, but, I still burn

Yeah, Love, hate, love
Oooh, Love, hate, love
Yeah, Love, hate, love"
It Ain't Like That,"There I was, laid out on a table
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor
In my life, I'd not soften
Things that cut, and burn so often
But I sit, think of somethin'
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
Where I go is when I feel I'm able
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore
In my mind, not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to think of words you can't ignore
In my eyes, what I'm lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore"
Sunshine,"One, a-one time, yeah
Am I too contagious
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise
Burning corpsed pyre

Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more
Suck your woman down
Am I your reflection
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value
Do my love defile
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more
Ain't no day the sun don't crack
Then to brand some name across my back so you care?
Find someone to tell you
Sunshine...sweet love my labor
Don't mind...I don't care no more

Mother please, come for me

Is my soul entire?

Who Ever Said,"Drowning in their dissertations
Random speakers in my mind
Yeah, they never stop their fortifications
And blocking my precious time
You used to let it go and let it float away
You don't get to speak with twice as much to say
It's all in the delivery
I said the messenger who is now dead
Was all on the periphery
I didn't see him but I heard what he said
Aw, sideways talk, poisoning our thoughts
Everyone walks and it's no one's fault
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said

Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Home is where
The broken heart is
Home is where
Every scar is
Blinking stars, beneath you roam
Room to tomb and cradle to grave
All the answers will be found
In the mistakes that we have made
Oh, oh, oh
One bad ear and one eye blind
It takes a village but don't take mine
Living forwards in a backwards town
I feed 'em drinks just to watch 'em drown
Swallow my pencil and bleed out my pen
Surrender the wish we'll be together again
And I won't give up
I won't give up
On satisfaction, satisfaction
Gave up on satisfaction
Pull myself aside on a sleepless night
Sadness blurs, I'm in need of a light
Out of balance, balance, balance this time
I'm feeling fading, calling as I'm falling out of sight
As the silence gets louder my heart gets pounding
And ventricles pumping, working overtime
Our freedoms fraught with danger being circumscribed
A life cut short and circumcised
A rubble of commandments from the road, step aside
A rubble of commandments in the road, step aside
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction

I can see you when I close my eyes
Once, you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right
Ask for forgiveness, I beg of myself
Feeling angry, knock it off the shelf
Right now I feel a lack of innocence
Searching for reveal, hypnotonic resonance
I feel not much of anything
And the cause is life or death
Throughout the hopelessness, focus on your focusness
I've been hoping that our hope dies last
I don't know anything, I question everything
This life I love is going way too fast
Both my eyes are swollen, my face is broken
And I'm hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your fist
She was a stunner and I am stunned
And the first thought and second thought was ""could be the one""
I was a prisoner, her keys and the cuffs
Yeah, I was feeling fortunate to be locked up
But the world kept a-spinning, always felt like it was ending
And love notwithstanding, we are each of us fucked
I would hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes

Dance Of The Clairvoyants,"Confusing it is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
As big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation
Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before
The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man can be greater than the sun
It's not a negative thought
But positive, positive, positive
Falling down, not staying down
Coulda held me up, rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river
Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before
Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor
We're stuck in the boxes
When it's open no more
Could’ve lifted up they’re forgetting us
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world
I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks, and fix and file things
I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
(I know the girls wanna dance away their circumstance)
(I know the boys wanna grow their dicks and fix and file things)
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes"
Quick Escape,"Reconnaissance on the corner
In the old world not so far
First we took an aeroplane
Then a boat to Zanzibar
Queen cranking on the blaster
And mercury did rise
Come along where we all belonged
You were yours and I was mine
Had to,... QUICK ESCAPE
Had to,... QUICK ESCAPE
Crossed the border to Morocco
Kashmir then Marrakech
The lengths we had to go to then
To find a place Trump hadn't fucked up yet
Living life on the back porch
Lifting rocks to make a wage
Every sunset paid attention to
Not a starry night went to waste
Had to,... QUICK ESCAPE
Had to,... QUICK ESCAPE
And here we are, the red planet
Craters across the skyline
A sleep sack in a bivouac
And a Kerouac sense of time
And we think about the old days
Of green grass, sky and red wine
Should’ve known, so fragile
And avoided this one way flight"
Alright,"You can't hide the lies
In the rings of a tree
If your heart still beats free
Keep it for yourself
When you want to run
And leave some part unrevealed
Like the flight of the bee
Keep it for yourself
It's alright to be alone
To listen for a heartbeat, it's your own
It's alright to quiet up
To disappear in thin air, it's your own
Should your living truth die
Could be an acid trip
Leave the Eucharist whole
Keep it for yourself
If you tire of the game
Hit the road towards the clouds
Find your groove in the sound
Keep it for yourself
It's alright to say no
Be a disappointment in your own home
It's alright to turn it off
Ignore the rules of the state, it's your own
It's alright to shut it down
Disappear in thin air, it's your home
It's alright to be alone
To listen for a heartbeat, it's your own
You can't hide your eyes"
Seven O'Clock,"Oh, seven o'clock in the morning, got a message from afar
Down under an oasis where there are dreams still being born
And summer spoke to winter, relaying all encouraging words
And I was fully grateful mutant messages were heard
Moved on from my despondency and left it in the bed
Do I leave it there still sleeping or maybe kill it better yet?
For this is no time for depression or self-indulgent hesitance
This fucked up situation calls for all hands, hands on deck
Freedom is as freedom does and freedom is a verb
They giveth and they taketh and you fight to keep that what you've earned
We saw the destination, got so close before it turned
Swim sideways from this undertow and do not be deterred
Floodlight dreams go drifting past
All the lines we could've had
Distant loves floating above
Close these eyes, they've seen enough
Caught the butterfly, broke its wings then put it on display
Stripped of all its beauty once it could not fly high away
Oh, still alive like a passerby overdosed on gamma rays
Another god's creation destined to be thrown away
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, they forged the north and west
Then you got Sitting Bullshit as our sitting president
Oh, talking to his mirror, what's he say, what's it say back?
A tragedy of errors, who'll be the last to have a laugh?
His best days gone, hard to admit
Throwing angry punches with nothing to hit
Luminous thoughts were once all he had
Fading lights, lost eloquence
There's still a fire in the engine room
Knows relief will be coming soon
What's to be done?
Carve a path for rivers reign
Much to be done
Oceans rising with the waves, oh
Held by these thoughts
They refuse to slip away, oh
Hangman in dreamland
About to call your name
Much to be done
Much to be
Much to be done
Much to be
Much to be done
Much to be
Much to be done"
Never Destination,"Blisters on my fingers, blisters on my brain
Blisters on the voices, crazy makes insane
There's an angry sea, an ocean in my eyes
The waves are rolling, I'm becoming blind
I won't be taken, won't take myself
Kicking and screaming, have to knock me off the shelf
Feels like illusion, is this taking place?
Disease of confusion, stripped of our grace
Don't wanna believe it, these endless miles
Never destination, just more denial
More denial
Some resolution, some justice tied
To this collusion hiding in plain sight
Say see ya later, never say goodbye
This is a little trick I play on my own mind
I am a recluse in search of new friends
Are they gonna find me back where the road ends?
Off in the distance, leviathans
50 foot and breaking on our innocence
Don't wanna believe it, these endless miles
Never destination, just more denial
More denial
I can't believe it, these endless lies
Never destination, just more denial
More denial
When you make the drop, the gaping maw
When you make the drop, the gaping maw
Makes us alive, should we survive
When you make the drop, the gaping maw
Keeps us alive, survive
When you make the drop, the gaping maw
Thank you Bob Honey, thanks Paul Theroux
If I ever die, then to this place let me go
Off in the distance, leviathans
50 foot and breaking on my innocence
I won't be taken, won't take myself
Kicking and screaming, have to knock me off the shelf
Say see ya later, never say goodbye
This is a little trick I play on my own mind
Don't wanna believe it, these endless miles
Never destination, just more denial

Our time, our truth

Buckle Up,"I got blood
Blood on my hands
The stain of
Of a human

To my mother's wrath
Call lights
Bed sores and sponge baths
Firstly do no harm
Then put your seatbelt on
Buckle up
Buckle up
The drapes pull back
Reveal her wound
Her boy on her lap
A murderer groomed
Antiquities lost
Lost to the Nile
A sudden slip
A fall on the tile
Firstly do no harm
Then put your seatbelt on
Buckle up
Buckle up
Buckle up
Buckle up"
Comes Then Goes,"High or low, where'd you go?
Are you stuck in the middle?
A spectral invisible ghost

Like images of angels in the snow
Our courage melts away, it comes then goes
Where you been? Cannot find
A glimpse of my friend
Don't know where or when one of us left
The other behind
Divisions came and troubles multiplied
Incisions made by scalpel blades of time
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Can I say, how ya been?
I can guess and conjecture
My altered perceptions unclear
Please interfere
Sadness comes with it a sea of tears
Would some love be best had it not appeared?
Is this you? Here I stand
Intense recollections of pain, self-neglecting again
Like you, I keep it in
Thought you found a game where you could win
Yeah, it's all vivisection in the end
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
High or low, try again
She fell off the altar
A vision you caught her but then
A woodcut in red
I wish it was not you that she had led
Selfish navigation with no end
Where'd you sleep? Can I find
A deeper connection
In the face of rejection I'm trying
I'm trying
Evidence in the echoes of your mind
Leads me to believe we missed the signs
Can I try one last time?
Could all use a savior from human behavior sometimes
And the kids are alright
The Queen of Collections took your time
Sadness comes 'cause some of it was mine
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Comes then goes"
Retrograde,"Comes the summer rain
Cue the lightning and far off thunder again
Projecting through the clouds
In meditations, lifting out in the sound
The more mistakes, the more resolve
It's gonna take much more than ordinary love
To lift this up
Stars align they say when
Things are better than right now
Feel the retrograde spin us 'round, 'round
Seven seas are raising
Forever futures fading out
Feel the retrograde all around, 'round
Accelerate the change
Feeling equal and opposite all the same
Momentum rearranged
Shout, the echo, returning back but now changed
The rusted shapes refuse to fall
It's gonna take much more than ordinary love
To lift this up
Stars align they say when
Times are better than right now
Feel the retrograde spin us 'round, 'round
Seven seas are raising
Forever futures fading out
Feel the retrograde all around, 'round
Hear the sound
In the distance now
Could be thunder
Or a crowd
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)
(Hear the sound)"
River Cross,"I always thought I'd cross that river
The other side, distant now
As I got close, it turned and widened
Horizon now fading out
Drifting off in the undertow
Can't spot a figure on dry land
And afterthoughts of safety
When in truth, none to be had
None to be had
I used to tell time by my shadow
'Til the thunderclouds, they took the stage
These days will end as do the light's rays
Another read of the same page
Wide awake through this deepest night
Still waiting on the sun
As the hours seem to multiply
Find a star to soldier on
Living beneath a lion's paw
Knowing nothing can be tamed
Can be tamed
I want this dream to last forever
A wish denied to lengthen our time
I wish this moment was never ending
Let it be a lie that all futures die
While the government thrives on discontent
And there's no such thing as clear
Proselytizing and profitizing
As our will all but disappears
Folded over, forced in a choke hold
Outnumbered and held down
And all these talk of rapture
Look around at the promise now
Here and now
Here and now
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down
Won't hold us down
Won't hold us down
Live it out
Let it out
Get it out
Shout it out
Won't hold us down
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Share the light
Won't hold us down
Hold us down"
Getaway,"Everyone’s a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody is thinking they can all be delivered sitting in a box like lost and found
But I found my place and it’s all right
We’re all searching for a better way
Get this off my plate
It’s all right, I got my own way to believe
Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle all alone and sinking the bow
And if you want to have to pray, it’s all right
We all be thinking with our different brain get this off my plate
It’s all right, I got my own way to believe, it’s okay
Sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now, make your getaway
Science says we’re making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain’t profound
Silence says we’re not allowed to consider
Simon says stand up sit down you’re out
But I found my place
And it’s all right, I’m bearing witness to some better things, get this off my plate
It’s all right, I’ve got my own way to believe
It’s okay, sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
There’s no way, mine is mine and yours won’t take its place, now make your getaway
It’s okay, sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now make your getaway, it’s okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
For god’s sake, mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now, make your getaway
Now, make your getaway"
Mind Your Manners,"I got an unfortunate feelin'
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
now the truth is coming out
What they're taken is
more than a vow
They've taken young innocents
and then they throw em' on a burning pile
ah ay ay ay
And all along they're saying
mind your manners!
I caught myself believing
that I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use some hymn now
Try my patience,
my patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me wanna cry
Ah ay ay ay
And all along they're saying
mind your manners
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve our mystery
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else
And all along they're saying
Mind your manners
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve a mystery
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like it
Livin' Hell
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like it
Livin' Hell
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like it
Livin' Hell

My Father's Son,"[From the book verbatim]
I come from a genius and I am my father's son
Too bad he was a psychopath
And now I'm the next in line
Then there's dear mother, yeh Shirley
She's a work of art
Never got top dollar, but she gave us all our start
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool drowning me
Can I beg a release?
I'm a volunteer amputee
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA
Why such betrayal?
Got me tooth and nail
Yeh. How's about one conversation
With nothing else left to be had?
With this your young long lost song
And his never had dear old dad
Forget the insemination
And for that, I'm supposed to be glad?
What a pity you left us so soon
To climb your mountain of regret
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dark and deep
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA
Why such betrayal?
Gotta set sail
All the bright lights shining
As you're trying to breathe in thin air
Cannot forget you're hiding
Collected wounds left unhealed
When every thought you're thinking
Sinks you darker than a new moon sky
The far away lights rising
In the whites of your eyes
Now father you're dead and gone
And I'm finally free to be me
Thanks for all your fucked-up gifts
For which I got no sympathy
Now I'm living in a war torn place
Hear the bombs, A 5th Symphony
Thanks for this and thanks for that
Gotta let go legacy
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool drowning me
Can I beg a release?
I'm a volunteer amputee
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA
Why such betrayal?
Gotta set sail"
Sirens,"Hear the sirens, hear the sirens
Hear the sirens, hear the circus all go found
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe, I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear
I could take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear that someday this will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that, nothing lasts forever
I didn't care, before you were here
i danced in laughter, with the ever after
But, all things change, let this remain
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound, echoing closer, will they come for me, next time?
For every choice, mistake I made, is not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I'll wait, I'll understand
It's a fragile thing, this life we lead,
If I think too much, I can't get over
When by the grace, by which we live
Our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go,
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away
It's a fragile thing, this life we lead,
If I think too much, I can't get over
When by the grace, by which we live
Our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go,
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away,
The fear goes away, the fear goes away"
Lightning Bolt,"She comes on like a stone
But you don’t know where from she was thrown
Like a burning meteor from miles high
Looking for a place to land
She said ""Have you got yourself some sand?""
And whatever you’d reply she took as yes
Now she comes out the deep
With her newly planted seeds and soon you’re
Thrown down on your knees and then you’ll dig
And then before you know the weeds are obesely overgrown
With all the wild seeds she sows in your sleep
You gotta know you’ll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Always something and never nothing
Isn’t that the way we’re taught to be… to be
Flipping through the worn out pages
And stages when you knew not who to be
Yeah Yeah
Until the lightning strike sets you free
You gotta know you’ll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
The crashing stormy waves erode her shoreline everyday
Until the castle of her ways turns to sand
She holds her loving breast as her birds fall from her nest
Flying towards the great northwest
And with no repair in sight
There is no god with such might
As to open her world wide with subterfuge
And your death will soon arrive as she finally decides
That all her problems, they won’t die with you
A-yeah!… A-yeah!… A-yeah!
Never let her go
She’s a lightning bolt
Never let her go
She’s true
She's rock 'n roll
She's a lightning bolt
Uncontrollable
Like you"
Infallible,"Keep on locking your doors
Keep on just as before
Pay disasters no mind
Didn't get you this time
No friends left at the crime
Our ship's come in and it's sinking
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Want a third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance
All good things come to an end
This could be good as it gets
How's the view from the fence
You think we've been here before
You are mistaken
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
When progress could be plausible
In the verse we curse ourselves
By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before"
Pendulum,"Can't know what's high till you've been down so low
The future's bright, lit up with no where to go, to and fro the pendulum throws
We are here and then we go
my shadow left me long ago
Understand what we dont know
this might pass
this might last
this may go
easy come and easy go
easy left me a long time ago
I'm in the fire but I'm still cold
nothing works works for me anymore
ahh ahh ahh ahh ahhh
to and fro the pendulum throws"
Swallowed Whole,"I can feel the dawn, I can feel the earth
I can feel the living
All around, round, round, round
All around, round, round, round
I could choose a path, I could choose the word
I can start the healing, bring it
Now now now now
Bring it now, now, now
Whispered songs inside the wind
Breathing in forgiveness
Like vibrations with no end
Feel the planet humming
What is clear far from the noise
Get swallowed whole
I can feel the sun, I can see the sound
I can set myself right hear and
Drown, drown, drown, drown
Drown, drown, drown
I can feel the rush, I could clear the clouds
I could set the needle spinning
Loud, loud, loud, loud
Loud, loud, loud, loud
I can hear the crash, I can feel the pound
I can feel the current pulling
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Whispered songs inside the wind
Breathing in forgiveness
Like vibrations with no end
Feel the planet humming
What is clear far from the noise
Get swallowed whole
With no quiet to be found, spirit lifted off the ground
And what lies beyond the grave
Might be welcomed change and will come, come what may
With no rest in peace, until that day, yeah
I can choose the path, I can choose the word
I can start the healing, bring it
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
I could be the sun, I could be the sound
I could set myself right hear and
Drown drown drown drown
Drown drown drown drown
Whispered songs inside the wind,
Breathing in forgiveness
And the chapter I’ve not read
Turn the page"
Let The Records Play,"When the Kingdom comes he puts the records on
and with his blistered thumb hits play
and with the volume up he goes and fills his cup
and lets the drummer drum take away the pain, the pain
Breaking, forsaken, what’s that you’re taken?
Bleeding the feeling, he lets the records play
I should the future dim
The cigarette light’s in
the vaporizer green light grim
and when the shot glass talks he goes to listens up
until he’s nice and numb again, again
Shaken, the breaking, not one for faking
the reeling is healing, he lets the records play,
there’s wisdom in his ways
I’ve been down and I fell so hard and far from grace
I’ve been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face
I’ve been off but I'm up on my feet, my feet again
Shaken, forsaken, what’s that you’re taking?
Oh! The weeding, the feeling, he lets the records play
Shaken but breaking, not one for faking oh!
the reeling is healing, he lets the records play!
Oh, there’s wisdom in his ways"
Sleeping By Myself,"I should have known there was someone else
Down below I always kept it to myself
Now I believe in nothing
Not today, as I move myself out of your sight
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
I could never go with no one else
The hurt don't show, but who knows
Time will tell
Now I believe in nothing
But the pain
And I can't see this turning out right
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
Forever be sad and lonely
Forever never be the same
I close my eyes, wait for a sign
Am I just waiting in vain?
Oh I believe in love and disaster
Sometimes the two are just the same
I'm beginning to see, what's left of me
Is gonna have to be free to survive
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
Now I believe in nothing
But the pain
And I can't see this turning out right
I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight"
Yellow Moon,"Here far away
One could feel the earth vibrate
Moon changing shape and shade
as we all do under its gaze
Yellow moon on the rise
Yellow moon on the rise
Round we go, where we stop no one knows
So tonight the moon I go
Yellow moon on the rise
An echo that rings a bullet unchained
one life, one grave joins the parade
At night the sky grows dark with fallen stars
who comes so far a headstone and grave
the colors turns grey, the black and white fades
Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise"
Future Days,"If I ever were to lose you, I'd surely lose myself
Everything I have found here,
I've not found by myself
Try, and sometimes you'll succeed,
To make this man of me
All of my stolen missing parts
I've no need for anymore
I believe, and I believe cause I can see our future days
Days of you and me
Back when I was feeling broken
I focused on everything
You can't keep this in the ocean
No there's something out there here
All the complexities and games
No one wins, but somehow, they still play
All the missing crooked hearts
We may die, but in us they live on
I believe, and I believe cause I can see our future days
Days of you and me
When hurricanes and cyclones rage
When wind turned dirt to dust
When floods they came and the tides they raised ever
Closer became old
All the promises at sundown
I meant them like the rest
All the demons used to come around
I'm grateful now they've left
So persistent in my ways, dear angel, I am here, stay
No resistance , no alarms, please this is just too good to be gone
I believe, and I believe case I can see, our future days
Days of you and me
You and me
You and me"
Gonna See My Friend,"Do you want to hear something sad?
We are but victims of desire
I'm gonna shake this day
I wanna shake this day before I retire
I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
Bueno sera, I won't be long before we all walk off the wire
Well I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require

Want to give it up.
Want to see it go once and for all
Want to view it cho'
Want a little bit home
Want to be there
Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, ?
Gonna take me an astral plane
I'm gonna tunnel through denial
But I'm gonna shake this day
I wanna shake this day before I retire
I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

The Fixer,"When something’s dark let me shed a little light on it
When something’s cold let me put a little fire on it

Johnny Guitar,"Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me
Riding on three wheels, a woman on his knee
With a leg under a red dress i wish i could see
Further north a warmth alive & lingering
Now Johnny he be having lots of women
The reason he be smiling known to him
On the left the girl in red so innocent
Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
The type of girl responsible for original sin
Can't help but wonder where & who she is
And the memory is always getting clearer
For that's 30 years or more i've loved her so
And i know i need to know.. why she's with him
And i sleep with the light on.. in case she comes
And i sleep with the light on.. in case she
Recently as i was waiting on a dream
She came to visit lost & lonely me
She leaned over the bed & with her lips above my head
She asked if i had seen her Johnny
Oh and i hide my disappointment
Cause for years i had been hoping
Oh yeah, i had been hoping
That when she came, she would come for me
I hide my disappointment
Cause for years i had been hoping
That when she came,
She'd be coming just for me
I hide my disappointment
Cause for years i had been hoping
That when she came,
She'd be coming just for me"
Just Breathe,"Yes I understand
That every life must end
As we sit alone
I know someday we must go
Yeah I'm a lucky man
To count on both hands
The ones I love
Some folks just have one
Yeah others they got none
Stay with me
Let's just breathe
Practised are my sins
Never gonna let me win
Under everything
Just another human being
I don't want to hurt
There's so much in this world
To make me bleed
Stay with me
All I see
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didin't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean
I wonder everyday
As I look upon your face
Everything you gave
And nothing you would take
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me 'till I die
Meet you on the other side"
Amongst The Waves,"What used to be a house of cards
Has turned into a reservoir
Save the tears that were waterfalling
Let's go swim tonight, darlin'
And once outside the undertow
Just you and me and nothin' more
If not for love I would be drownin
I've seen it work both ways
But I am up
Riding high amongst the waves
I can feel like I
Have a soul that has been saved
I can feel like I've
Put away my early grave
I gotta say it now
Better now than too late
Remember back the early days
When you were young and thus amazed
Suddenly the channel changed
the first time you saw blood
Cut to later now you're strong
You've bled yourself the wounds are gone
It's rare when there's nothing wrong
Survive and you're amongst the fittest
Love ain't love until you give it up
Riding high amongst the waves
I can feel like I
Have a soul that has been saved
I can see the light
Coming through the clouds in rays
I gotta say it now
Better now than too late"
Unthought Known,"All the thoughts you never see
You are always thinking
Brain is wired, brain is deep
Oh are you sinking?
Feel the path of everyday
Which road you taking?
Breathing hard, making hay
Yeah this is living
Look for love and evidence
That you're worth keeping
Swallowed whole in negatives
It's so sad and sickening
Feel the air up above
Oh, Full of blue sky
Fill the air up with love
Oh, Black with starlight
Feel the sky blanket you
With gems and rhinestones
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
For you to walk on
Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing there
Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
See the waves on distant shores
Waiting your arrival
Dream the dreams of other men
You'll be no one's rival
Dream the dreams of others then
You will be no one's rival
You will be no one's rival
You will be no one's rival

Yeah, I been dreamin' of gettin' along
Now I'm awake dreamin' keepin' on, keep it up
I test your faith then I punch through the hip
I smile big with a toothless grin, yeah
Supersonic goin' into my soul
I caught the rhythm but ain't got much soul, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah
Yeah...
Yeah, I been thinkin' I already know
Nothin' 'bout nothin' or so I have been told, yeah
I'm not the paper, I'm more like the fold
I cut the crease, put the shit in the hold, yeah
Supersonic goin' into my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah
Supersonic, gonna feel it now
I need to hear it just to feel it loud, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full...
Supersonic gonna take my soul
I stopped the rhythm but my god was full, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah

Speed Of Sound,"Yesterdays, How quick they change
All lost and long gone now
Want to remember anything moving at the speed of sound
With the speed of sound
And yet I'm still holdin' tight to this dream of distant light
In that, somehow I'll survive, but this night has been a long one
Waiting on a sun that just don't come
Can I forgive what I cannot forget
And live a lie?
I could give it one more try
Why deny this, drive inside, just looking for some peace
Every time I get me some it gets the best of me
Not much left, you see
And yet I'm still holdin' tight to this dream of distant light
In that, somehow I'll survive, but this night has been a long one
Waiting on a word that never comes
A whisper in the dark
Is that you or just my thoughts
I'm wide awake and reaching out
Its gone so quiet now
Could it be I'm farther out
Movin' faster than the speed of sound"
Force Of Nature,"Understand she's a force of nature
Contraband hiding deep inside her soul
Exercise in the will to lose control
She lets go
Common man he don't stand a chance no
One to love gonna allow this in the hole
No way to save someone who won't take the rope
And just lets go
One man stands the end of the ocean
A beacon on dry land
Eyes above the horizon
In the dark before the dawn
Hurricane has the trade winds blowing
Gale force shakin windows in the storm
Shipwrecked on the rock that he calls home
With one light on
Somewhere there's a siren singing
A song only he hears
All the strength, you might think
Would disappear resolving
One man stands alone awaiting
For her to come home
Eyes above the horizon
In the dark before the
darkness meets the dawn
Makes me ache
Makes me shake
Is it so wrong to think that
Love can keep us safe?
Last I saw he was out there waiting
Silhouette in the black light full moon glow
In the sand there he stands upon the shore
Forever more
Somewhere there's a siren singing
A song only he hears
All the strength, you might think
Would disappear resolving
One man stands alone awaiting
For her to come home
Eyes are closed, you cannot know
But his heart don't seem to know"
The End,"What were all those dreams we shared those many years ago,
What were all those plans we made, now left beside the road.
Behind us in the road.
More than friends, I always pledge, cuz friends they come and go,
People change as does everything, I wanted to grow old,
I just want to grow old.
Slide on next to me,
I'm just a human being,
I will take the blame, but just the same, this is not me, you see, believe, I'm better than this
don't leave me so cold,
I'm buried beneath the stones,
I just want to hold on and know I'm worth your love, and I, don't think, there's such a thing.
It's my fault now, I've been caught, a sickness in my bones.
How do you think it is to leave you here with the kids on your own,
Just don't let me go.
Help me see myself,
Cuz I can no longer tell,
Looking up from inside of the bottom of a well, it's Hell, I yell, but no one hears before, I disappear, whisper in my ear.
Give me something to echo in my unknown future, you see, my dear, the end, comes near, I'm here, but not much longer."
Better Man,"Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she'd do it, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
She loved him
She don't want to leave this way
She feeds him
That's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man"
Life Wasted,"You're always saying that there's something wrong.
I'm starting to believe it's your plan all along.
Death came around, forced to hear it's song
And know tomorrow can't be depended on
Seen the home inside your head.
Unlocked doors and unmade beds
Open sores unattended
Let me say just once that
I have faced it, a life wasted.
I'm never going back again.
I escaped it,a life wasted.
I'm never going back again.
Having tasted, a life wasted.
I'm never going back again.
The world awaits just up the stairs
Leave the pain for someone else
Nothing back there for you to find
Or was it you you left behind
You're always saying you're too weak to be Strong.
You're harder on yourself than just about Anyone
Why swim the channel just to get this far?
Halfway there, why would you turn around?
Darkness comes in waves...tell me,
Why invite it to stay?
You're one with negativity
Yes, comfort is an energy
But why let the sad song play?
I have faced it, a life wasted
I'm never going back again
Oh I escaped it, a life wasted
I'm never going back again
Having tasted, a life wasted
I'm never going back again
Oh I erased it, a life wasted
I'm never going back again"
World Wide Suicide,"I felt the earth on Monday
It moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper
Laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a color picture
I recognized the name
Could not stop staring at the
Face I'd never see again
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when
a war has taken over?
It's the same every day
In a hell man-made
What can be saved and
who will be there to hold her?
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
Medals on a wooden mantle
Next to a handsome face
That the President took for granted
Writing checks that others pay
And in all the madness
Thought become numb and naive
So much to talk about, there's
Nothing for to say
It's the same every day
And the wave won't break
Tell you to pray while
the devil's on their shoulder
Laying claim to the take that soldiers save
Does not equate and
The truth's already out there
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
Looking in the eyes of the fallen
You've got to know there's another
Another
Another
Another
Another
waaaaayyyyyyyyyyy
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when
a war has taken over
It's the same every day
And the wave won't break
Tell you to pray while
the devil's on their shoulder
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide
The whole world
World over
It's a World Wide Suicide"
Comatose,"Consider me an object
Put me in a vacuum
Free of all conditions
Free of air and friction
Yea, I’ll be hanging upside down.
And there I will swing
For all eternity
Fell it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling
Consider me an abscess
Leave me in my vacuum
Blood on all the pistons
Running my transmission
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling
Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling
Feel It rising
High above I’ll break the law,
If it’s illegal to be in love,
Leave the hatred, on the cross
Yea I’ll be hanging upside down and here I will swing
For all eternity
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose with no fear of falling
Feel it rising, yea, next stop falling
Feel it rising
Something never thought you’d be part of..."
Severed Hand,"Big man stands behind an open door
Said, leave your lady on the cement floor.
Got some kicks, want to take a ride?
I said, yeah!
“take your pick, leave yourself behind”
I said, yeah!
I've no fear but for falling down
So look out below I am falling now
Oh please understand I just need, my friend,
a way a way a way home
Tried to walk, found a severed hand
Recognized it by the wedding band
Said it’s ok, do you want some more?
I said, yeah!
Said You’ll see dragons after 3 or 4
I said, yeah!
Under stand I’m not falling down
I said, look around, the rooms taller now,
I can’t close my eyes,
‘cause I see the sound in waves
In wave, lets me stay calm
If I don’t lose control
Explore and not explode
A preternatural other plane
With the power to maintain
Like a tear in all we know
Once dissolved we are free to grow
What is human, what is more?
I’ll answer this when I get home"
Marker In The Sand,"There is a marker, no one sees it 'cause the sand
Has covered over, all the messages it kept
Misunderstanding, what original truth was
And out expanding, in a faith, but not in love
What went wrong?
Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Seeing visions of falling up somehow
Do come down
With the living let what is living love
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
God, what do you say?
Those undecided needn't have faith to be free
And those misguided, there was a plan for them to be
Now you got both sides claiming killing in God's name
But god is nowhere to be found, conveniently
What goes on?
Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Walk the bridges before you burn them down
Do come round
With the living let what is living love
Unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
God, what do you say? What do you say?
I feel a sickness. A sickness coming over me
Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea
And the solution? Well, from me far would it be
But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me
What goes wrong?
Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Seeing visions of falling up somehow
Do come down
With the living, let what is living love
Are forgiving, yet needing forgiveness first
What do you say? God, what do you say?
What do you say?
Calling out, calling out
Calling out, I'm calling you out"
Parachutes,"Why deny all the troubles when combined
With the missing links it don’t feel like home now
That your gone all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum
You’re always wishing and never here at home
You all the dreams we shared and
lights we turned on
but the house is getting dark
and I don’t want to know your past
but together share the dawn
and I won’t need nothing else
cause when we’re dead
we would’ve had it all and died
I would’ve fallen from the sky til you
Parachutes have opened now
Heaven knows if there’s a ceiling
Come so low with the kneeling
Please know that I got all the friends I’m needing
Before my light go out
As the doors are closing now
And far away will be my home
And to grasp this, I don’t know
But I don’t need
Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today
And love
Wish the world could glo again with love
One can’t see to have enough
And war
Break the sky and tell me what it’s for
I’ll travel there on my own
And love
What a different life
Had I not found this love with you"
Unemployable,"He's got a big gold ring which says ""Jesus Saves""
And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day,
Where he smashed a metal locker where he kept his things
After the big boss said you'd best be on your way
Oh yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
Jumping trains just to survive
Well his wife and kids' asleep but he's still awake
On his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate
Thinkin if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream
Yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
To a stranger's bottom line
Oh yeah...
I've seen the light
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I'm scared of life
Near to death
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I've seen the light
Scared of life
Yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
Was a dream that had to die
Oh yeah...
I've seen the light
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
And I'm scared alive
Near to death
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I've seen the light
Scared alive
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohhhhhh Ohhh..
And I'm near to death
Here to die
Scared alive
Near to death
Here to die
Scared alive..."
Big Wave,"I used to be crustacean
In an underwater nation
And I surf in celebration
Of a billion adaptations
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
I feel the need
Planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see
The oceans size?
Defining time
And tide
Arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind
To let me ride
I scream in affirmation
Of connecting dislocations
And exceeding limitation
By achieving levitation
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.
I feel the need
planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see
The oceans size?
Defining time
And tide
Arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind
To let me ride
Got me a ride
I got me a ride"
Gone,"No more upset mornings
No more trying evenings
It's the American Dream I am disbelieving.
When the gas in my tank feels like money in the bank
I’m gonna blow it all this time, take me one last ride.
The lights of the city, they only look good when I’m speeding
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I’m gone
Gone, going for it all this time, gone.
In the far off distance
As my taillights fade
No one to witness but they will someday
Feel like a question is forming
And the answers
I will be what I could be
Once I get out of this town.
The lights of this city
They’ve lost all of their feeling
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I’m gone
Gone, going for it all, this time I’m gone
Nothing is everything
I’ll have it all
If nothing is everything then I will have it all.
I’m gone."
Wasted Reprise,"I have faced it
A life wasted
I'm never going back again
I escaped it

Having tasted
A life wasted
I'm never going back again"
Army Reserve,"How long must she stand
Before the ground, it gives way
To an endless fall
She can feel this
War on her face
Stars on her pillow
She's folding in darkness
Begging for slumber
I'm not blind
Can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye
I'm not frantic
I can feel it coming
Violently shakes
My body
Her son's slanted
Always giving her
The sideways eye
And empty chair where dad sits
How loud can silence get?
And mom, she reassures
To contain him
But it's becoming a lie
She tells herself
And everyone else
Father is risking
His life for our freedoms
I'm not blind
I can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye
I'm no frantic
I can feel it coming
Darling you'll save me
If you save yourself"
Come Back,"If I keep holding out
Will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof
It's only rain that I feel
I've been wishin' out the days
Oh oh oh
Come back
I have been planning out
All that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away
Know that I still remain true
I've been wishin' out the days
Please say that if you hadn't have gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are
Oh oh oh oh
Come back
And these days, they linger on, yeah, yeah
And in the night, I've been waiting for
A real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep
If I don't fall apart
Will my memory stay clear?
So you had to go
And I had to remain here
But the strangest thing to date
So far away and yet you feel so close
I'm not going to question it any other way
It must be an open door for you
To come back
And the days they linger on, yeah
Every night I'm waiting for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me
And it's ok
It's ok, it's ok
I'll be here
Come back, come back
I'll be here
Come back, come back
I'll be here
Come back, come back
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
Oooooooo"
Inside Job,"Underneath this smile lies everything
All my hopes and anger, pride and shame
Make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past
Just for today I am free
I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today
I know this one thing well…
I used to try and kill love. the highest sin
Breathing insecurity out and in
Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight
Pursuing the greater way for all human light.
How I choose to feel is how I am.
How I choose to feel is how I am.
I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today
Holding on, the light of night
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul
Again
Let me run into the rain
To be a human light again
Let me run into the rain
To shine a human light today
Life comes from within your heart and desire
Life comes from within my heart and desire
Life comes from within your heart and desire"

Love Boat Captain,"is this just another day, this god forgotten place
first comes love and then comes pain, let the games begin
questions rise and answers fall, insurmountable
love boat captain, take the reigns and steer us towards the clear, here
it's already been sung, but it can't be said enough
all you need is love
is this just another phase? of earthquakes making waves
trying to shake the cancer off? oh, stupid human beings
once you hold the hand of love, it's all surmountable
hold me and make it the truth
that when all is lost there'll be you
cuz to the universe, i don't mean a thing
and there is just one word i still believe
and it's love...
it's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey
lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today
and if our lives became too long, would it add to our regret?
and the young they can lose hope
cuz they can't see beyond today...
the wisdom that the old can't give away, hey
constant recoil
sometimes life don't leave you alone
hold me and make it the truth
that when all is lost there will be you
cuz to the universe, i don't mean a thing
and there is just one word and i still believe
and it's love... love, love, love, love

Cropduster,"light green to green, dark green, brown

Ghost,"the mind is grey like the city, packing in and overgrown

driving (away, away)
finding, hoping, ways i missed before
i missed before
the tv, she talks to me
breaking news and building walls
selling me what i don't need

I Am Mine,"The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by
I only own my mind
North is to South what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
In between is mine
I am mine
And the feeling it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significance behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine
And the feeling it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significance between the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
What
And no feeling that gets left behind
All the innocent lost among time
We are all different behind the eyes
There is no need to hide
And the feeling that gets left behind
All the innocence broken with lies
Yeah. We are all doomed behind the eyes
They're saying to hide
Yeah, yeah yeah"
Thumbing My Way,"I have not been home since you left long ago
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Counting steps walking backwards on the road
I'm counting my way back to heaven
I can't be free with what's locked inside of me
If there was a key you took it in your hand
There's no wrong or right, but I'm sure there's good and bad
The questions linger overhead
No matter how cold the winter there's a springtime ahead
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
I wish that i could hold you, I wish that I had
thinking 'bout heaven
I let go of the rope thinking that's what held me back
And in time i've realized, it's now wrapped around my neck
I can't see what's next from this lonely overpass
Hang my head and count my steps, as another car goes past
All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives
Choosing the shiny ones instead
I turned my back, now there's no turning back
No matter how cold the winter there's a springtime ahead
I smile but who am I kidding?
I'm just walking the miles, every once in a while get a ride
Thumbing my way back to heaven"
You Are,"This broken wheel is coming undone
And the road's exploding
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you
Love is a tower, and you're the key
Leading me higher, when you let me in
Keeping us close (so close)
Oh, on down the line
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
With no one knowing
But you're keeping me strong
Moving along with you
You are a tower, of strength to me
The darkening hour, sees light again
Again...
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are...
Love is a tower, of strength to me
I am the shoreline, but you're the sea
The sea
You are, you are...

Bu$hleaguer,"how does he do it? how do they do it? uncanny and immutable
this is such a happening tailpipe of a party

he's not a leader, he's a texas leaguer
swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike
drilling for fear makes the job simple
born on third, thinks he got a triple

blackout weaves its way through the city
blackout weaves its way...
i remember when you sang that song about today
now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
a think tank of aloof multiplication
a nicotine wish and a columbus decanter
retrenchment and hoggishness
the aristocrat choir sings, ""what's the ruckus?""
the haves have not a clue
the immenseness of suffering

1/2 Full,"climbing on the mountain, floating out on the sea
far from lights of a city, the elements they speak to me
whispering that life, existed long before greed
and balancing the world on its knee
don't see some men as half empty, see them half full of shit
thinking that we're all but slaves
there ain't gonna be
no middle anymore, it's been said before
the haves be having more, yet still bored
won't someone save?
won't someone save the world?

that this hopeless situation

here's the selfless confession
leading me back to war
can we help that our destinations

Breakerfall,"Ah.
There's a girl on a ledge who's got nowhere to turn.
Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned.
Now her life is on fire it's no ones concern.
She can blame the world or prey till dawn.
But only love can break her fall.
Break her fall. Yeah, only love can break her fall. Fall.
It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth and she's standing outside hating everyone here.
Yeah, she's her own disease, crying to her doll.
But only love can break her fall.
Break her fall. Only love can break her fall. Yeah.
Yeah fall. Blame the world. Break her fall. Break her fall.
Love, love, love can break her fall. Who?
Now only love can break her fall.
Love, love can break her fall. Fall.
Love, love can break her fall.
Only love can break her."
Gods' Dice,"It's out of my hands making your hands meet.
Stumble rises crumbling out of reach.
It's in the cards of destiny your sanity in tow.
Designate my luck. Uh resignate.
This power has no roots to guide. No role.
Trust me. Rusted minds refuse to go.
Unwillingness is meaningless to walk away in vain.
Designate my will.
Ah, designate my fill.
Ah resignate.
My will is crashing. Synapses flashing slow.
Ah, days like frame by frame. Where do they go?
Ah yeah, why fight? Forget it. Cannot spend it after I go.
Roll them high. Throw them again. All god's dice.
Monkey driven. Call this living? Ha.
Ah, too much thought it's overwrought a hole.
Yeah, minding yours what's mine not yours.
Will finish us off.
Ah, designate my life.
Ah, designate my view.
Ah, resignate my will, my will, my will, I will.
Resignate my god."
Evacuation,"The sirens scream wanton attention.
Time to take heed and change direction.
Time to take stock and make omissions.
Evacuation. Evacuation.
Time to take leave all formal functions.
Time to plant seeds of a reconstruction.
No time this time to feign reluctance.
It's like your waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way.
Bets put aside you're evil. Lets crawl into your face.
A vision vague or not raising a frightful wake you up.
Time for evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation.
Evacuation. Evacuation.
There was a solemn man. Watched his twilight disappear. In the sand.
Altered by a falling eagle. A warning sign. Sign.
He sensed that worry could be strength with a plan he said, ""Time for evacuation.""
Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation. Evacuation."
Light Years,"I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I've deciphered tricks at the bar
But now your gone
I haven't figured out why
I've come up with riddles
And jokes about war
I've figured out numbers and what there for
I've understood feelings
And I've understood words
But how could you be taken away
And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
Today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now
Reflected from afar
We were but stones
Your light made us stars
With heavy breath
Awakened regrets
Back pages and days alone the could've been spent
Together but we were miles apart
Every inch between becomes light years now
No time to be void
Or save up on life
Oh you've got to spend it all
And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
You seemed to like it here
Your light's reflected now
Reflected from afar
We were but stones
Your light made us stars
And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
Today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now
Reflected from afar
We were but stones
Your light made us stars"
Nothing As It Seems,"Don't feel like home. He's a little out.
And all these words elope. It's nothing like your poem.
Putting in. Inputting in. Don't feel like methadone.
A scratching voice all alone it's nothing like your baritone.
It's nothing as it seems. The little that he needs. It's home.
The little that he sees. Is nothing he concedes. It's home.
One uninvited chromosome. A blanket like the ozone.
It's nothing as it seems. All that he needs. It's home.
The little that he frees is nothing he believes.
Saving up a sunny day. Something maybe two tone.
Anything of his own. A chip off the corner stone.
Who's kidding? Rainy day. A one way ticket headstone.
Occupations overthrown. A whisper through a megaphone.
It's nothing as it seems. The little that he needs. It's home.
The little that he sees is nothing he concedes. It's home.
And all that he frees. A little bittersweet. It's home.
It's nothing as it seems. The little that you see it's home."
Thin Air,"There's a light, when my baby's in my arms.
There's a light, when the window shades are drawn.
Hesitate when I feel I may do harm to her.
Wash it off cause this feeling we can share.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
Byzantine is reflected in our pond.
There's a cloud, but the water remains calm.
Reaching in the suns fingers clutch the dawn to pass.
Even out, it's a precious thing to bear.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
It's not in my past to presume.
Love can keep on moving in both directions.
How to be happy and true is the quest we're taking on together.
Take it on, on, on, on, on.
Take it on, on, on, on, on.
There's a light when my baby's in my arms.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air.
Yes I know she's reached my heart."
Insignificance,"All in all it's no one's fault
Excuses turn to carbon walls
Blame it all on chemical intercourse
The swallowed seeds of arrogance
Breeding in the thoughts of ten
Thousand fools that fight irrelevance
The full moon is dead skin
The one down here's wearing thin
So set up the ten pins
As the human tide rolls in
Like a ball that's spinning
Bombs dropping down
Overhead, on the ground
It's instilled
To want to live
Bombs dropping down
Please forgive our hometown
In our insignificance
""Turn the jukebox up,"" he said
Dancing in irreverance
Play C-3
Let the song protest
The plates began to shift
Pefect lefts come rolling in
I was alone and far away
Hey
When I heard the band start playing
On the lip they take off
Bombs dropping down
Overhead, underground
It's instilled
To want to live
Bombs dropping down
Please forgive our hometown
In our insignificance
Feeling like resonance of distance
In the blood the iron lies
It's instilled
To want to live
Bombs dropping down
Please forgive our hometown
In our insignificance"
Of the Girl,"Oh he deals 'em, off, off of the top, ties 'em off
Fills it up with his past, gets carried away
Oh, half his life, a hand me down, wasted away
Oh, he fills it up with the love of a girl
Oh he left it alone, drilled the pain with money to buy
How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
Oh he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four
Fills his night with the thought of a girl
How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
Getaway"
Grievance,"Have a drink they're buying.
Bottom of bottle of denial.
Big eye, big eye watching me.
Have to wonder what it sees. Sin.
Progress laced with ramifications.
Freedom's big punch. Oh.
Pull the innocent from a crowd.
Raise those sticks them bring them down.
If they fail to obey.
Ah, if they fail to obey. Yeah yeah.
For every tool they lend us a loss of independence.
I pledge my grievance to the flag.
Cause you don't give blood then take it back again.
Oh we're all deserving something more.
Progress. Taste it. Invest it all.
Champagne breakfast for everyone. Everyone.
Break the innocent when they're proud.
Raise those stakes then bring them down.
If they fail to obey.
Yeah, ha, if they fail to obey.
Pledge your grievance to the flag.
Cause, don't give blood then take it back again.
Oh, we're all deserving something more.
Have a, have a drink, drink. Have a, have a drink, drink.
I want to breathe part of the scene.
I want to taste everyone I see.
I want to run when I'm up high.
I want to run to the sea.
I want life to be.
I just want to be.
I will feel alive as long as I am free."
Rival,"(dog playing tug-of-war)
All my rivals will see what I have in store. My gun.
I've been harboring fleets in this reservoir. Red sun.
And this nation's about to explode.
Your disciples are riddled with metaphors. Well hung.
Better pony up and bring both your barrels full. Not one.
As we release this unspeakable toll. Woh.
Every grain of sand equals all the stars around the world.
Ahh.
How's our mother to damn these contributors. With mud.
How will the man who made chemicals difficult. Shed blood.
How's our father supposed to be told.
I don't... ...know."
Sleight of Hand,"Routine was the theme
He'd wake up, wash and pour himself into uniform
Something he hadn't imagined being
As the merging traffic passed
He found himself staring down
At his own hands
Not remembering the change
Not recalling the plan
Was it?...
He was okay
But wondering
About wandering
Was it age?
By consequence?
Or was he moved sleight of hand?
Mondays were made to fall
Lost on a road he knew by heart
It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly
Sometimes he hid in his radio
Watching others pull into their homes
While he was drifting
On a line
Of his own
Off the line
Off the side
By the by
As dirt turned to sand
As if moved by sleight of hand
When he reached the shore of his clip-on world
He resurfaced to the norm
Organized his few things, his coat and keys
Any new realizations would have to wait
Till he had more time
More time
A time to dream
To himself
He waves goodbye
To himself
I'll see you on the other side
Another man moved by sleight of hand"
Soon Forget,"Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette.
Thinks he'll get the girl he'll only get the mechanic.
What's missing? He's living a day he'll soon forget.
That's one more time around. The sun is going down.
The moon is out but he's drunk and shouting.
Putting people down. He's pissing. He's living a day he'll soon forget.
Counts his money every morning. The only thing that keeps him horny.
Locked in a giant house that's alarming.
The townsfolk they all laugh.
Sorry is the fool who trades his love for hi-rise rent.
Seem the more you make equals the loneliness you get.
And it's fitting. He's barley living a day he'll soon forget.
That's one more time around and there is not a sound.
He's lying dead clutching Benjamins. Never put the money down.
He's stiffening. We're all whistling a man we'll soon forget."
Parting Ways,"Behind her eyes there's curtains and they've been closed to hide the flames. Remains.
She knows their futures burning but she can smile just the same. Same.
And though her mood is fine today there's a fear they'll soon be parting ways.
Standing like a statue. A chin of stone a heart of clay. Hey.
And thought he's too big a man to say there's a fear they'll soon be parting ways.
Drifting away. Drifting away. Drifting away. Away. Away.
Drifting away. Drifting away. Drifting away. Away. Away."
Brain of J.,"1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. Sorry. 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4.)
Who's got the brain of JFK?
What's it mean to us now. Yeah.
Pause, it sounds distrust.
But I can tell you this is no lie. Yeah.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved.
Yeah, trust.
You? You've been taught, whipped into shape, now they got you in line. Yeah.
Stand behind the stripes. There will be order, so give it a good mind there.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved. Woh.
And by name, the name they gave me, the name I'm letting go. Ahh.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved.
The whole world will be different soon.
The whole world will be relieved.
The whole world will be different soon."
Faithful,"Plaque on the wall says that no one's slept here
It's rare to come upon a bridge that has not been around
Or been stepped on
Whatever the notions we laced in our prayers
The man upstairs is used to all of this noise
I'm through with screaming
And echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes
Like echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes
We're faithful we all believe we all believe it {4X}
And echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes {2X}
We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it {3X}
So faithful, we all believe, we all believe it
M.Y.T.H. is?
Belief in the game controls that keeps us in a box of fear
We never listen
Voice inside so drowned out
Drowned you are, you are, you are a furry thing
And everything is you
Me you, you me, it's all related
What's a boy to do?
Just be darling and I will be too
Faithful to you"
No Way,"Here's a token of my openness
Of my need to not disappear
How I'm feeling, so revealing to me
I found my mind too clear
I just need someone to be there for.. me
I just want someone to be there for.. me
All the static in my attic-a
Shoots down my sciatic nerve
To the ocean of my platitudes
Longitudes, latitudes, it's so absurd
I just need someone to be there for..
I just want someone to be there for..
Someone to be there for..
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference
No way
Ooh, let's call in an angel
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference
No way
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference

Given to Fly,"He could've tuned in tuned in
But he tuned out
A bad time nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor waiting locked out
He got up outta there ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up set him down on his knee
A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
Delivered him wings ""Hey look at me now""
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh power oh
He's flying
Whole
High wide, oh
He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped and then he was stabbed
By faceless men, well, fuckers
He still stands
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly
High flying
Oh, oh
High flying
Oh, oh
He's flying
Oh, oh"
Wishlist,"I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off
I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on
The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top
I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
For 50 million hands upraised and open toward the sky
I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me
I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood
I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on
I wish I was the verb 'to trust' and never let you down
I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I guess it never stops..."
Pilate,"Talk of circles and punching out
Looking in drawing circles down
Falling up the south marking ground
Talking out of turn drawing circles down
Like Pilate I have a dog
Like Pilate I have a dog
Walks me out of town
Still one's a crowd
Making angels in the dirt
Looking up looking all around
Like Pilate I have a dog
{Obeys listens kisses loves}
Stunned by my own reflection
It's looking back, sees me too clearly
And I swore I'd never go there again
Not unlike a friend that politely drags you down, you down, you down
Like Pilate, I have a dog
{Obeys, listens, kisses, loves}"
Do the Evolution,"Woo
I'm ahead, I'm a man
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust
I can kill 'cause in god I trust, yeah
It's evolution, baby
I'm at piece, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rolling hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby
Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, he's my clone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This land is mine, this land is free
I'll do what I want but irresponsibly
It's evolution, baby

There's my church, I sing in the choir:
(Hallelujah, hallelujah)
Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, admire my clones
'Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant Indians got nothin' on me
Nothin', why?
Because it's evolution, baby!
I am ahead, I am advanced

MFC,"Sliding out of reverse into drive.
This wheel will be turning right, then straight.
Off in the sunset she'll ride.
She can remember a time, denied.
Stood by the side of the road.
Spilled like wine now.
She's out on her own and line high.
There's no leaving here.
Ask I'm an ear.
She's disappeared, now. Oh...
They said that timing was everything.

Low Light,"Clouds roll by.
""Reeling,"" is what they say.
Or is it just my way?
Wind blows by.
Low light. Sidetracked. Low light.
Can't see my tracks your scent way back.
Can I be here all alone?
Clear a path to my home.
Blood runs dry.
Books and jealousy tell me wrong.
I will feel calm.
Poise blows by.
Low light. Car crash. Low light.
Can wear my mask. Your first my last.
Voice goes by.
Two birds is what they'll see getting lost upon their way.
Wind rolls by.
Low light. Eye sight. Low light.
I need the light. I'll find my way from wrong.
What's real? The dream I see."
In Hiding,"I shut and locked the front door
No way in or out
I turned and walked the hallways
And pulled the curtains down
yeah I knelt and emptied the mouths of every club around
But nothing's sound
nothing's sound
I'd stay where my last step left me
Ignored all my rounds
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls
They were upside down
I swallow the truth to keep from lying
I swallow my face just to keep from biting
Yeah, I swallowed my breath, I went deep,
I was diving, I was diving
Yeah, I surfaced when all of my being was enlightened
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
It's been about three days now
Since I've been above ground
i'm no longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now
Yeah, it's funny how things change so much
It's all state of mind
I swallow the truth to keep from lying
I swallow my face just to keep from biting.
I, I am, I swallow my breath, I went deep,
I was diving, I was diving
Yeah, I surfaced when all of my being was enlightened
Now I'm in hiding
Now I'm in hiding
Now I'm in hiding
Now I'm in hiding
Now I'm in hiding

"Push Me, Pull Me","(Get me outta here... If reality is what I see...)
I had a false belief. I thought I came here to stay.
We're all just visiting. All just breaking like waves.
The oceans made me, but who came up with love?
Push me pull me, push me. Or pull me out.
Push me pull me. Or pull me out. (x2)
So if there were no angels would there be no sin?
Huh, you better stop me before I begin.
But let me say.
If I behave can you arrange a spacious hole in the ground?
Somewhere nice. Make it nice.
Where the land meets high tide.
Push me pull me. Or just pull me out.
Push me pull me.
Push me or pull me. Or pull me out.
Push me pull me, out.
Like a cloud dropping rain I'm discarding all thought.
I'll dry up leaving puddles on the ground.
I'm like an opening band for the sun.

Oh, don't you think you've got enough? Well, maybe yea.
You don't think there's time to stop.
There's time enough for you to lay your head down, tonight.
Tonight.
Maybe it'll wash away all those yesterdays.
What are you running from?
Taking pills to get along.
Creating walls to call your own.
So no one catches you drifting off and doing all the things that we all do.

Sometimes I reach to myself, dear God..."
"Hail, Hail","Ah, is there room for both of us? Both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got?

If you're the only one will I never be enough? Yeah.
Hail hail the lucky ones. I refer to those in love. Yeah.
Oh, how I'll love you til the day I die and beyond.
Are we going to the same place? If so can I come?
It's egg rolling thick and heavy. All the past you carry.
Oh, I could be new. You underestimate me.
If you're the only one will I never be enough? Yeah.
Hail hail the lucky ones. I refer to those in love. Yeah.
I sometimes realize I could only be as good as you'll let me.
Are you woman enough to be my man? Bandaged hand in hand.
I find it on the run in a race that can't be won. Yeah.
All hail the lucky ones. I refer to those in love. Yeah.
If you're my only one, so could you only one?
I want to be your one. Enough! You won no one. You're one."
Who You Are,"Come to send. Not condescend.
Transcendent to consequences.
To transcend where we are.
Who are we? Who we are.
Trampled marks on your souls.
Changes, all you're a part.

Can't defend fucked up men.
Take me for a ride before we leave.
Circumstance. Clapping hands.
A driving winds. Happenstance.
Off the track, in the mud.

Sidewalk cigarettes and scenes, (tem-pted)
Up here so high I start to shake
Up here so high the sky I scrape
I'm so high I hold just one breath here within my chest
Just like innocence

(Eddie's blue sky home)

I remember when, yeah
I swore I knew everything, oh yeah
Let's say knowledge is a tree, yeah
It's growing up just like me, yeah
I'm so light the wind he shakes
I'm so high the sky I scrape
I'm so light I hold just one breath and flew back to my nest
Sleep with innocence...
Up here so high the boughs they break
Up here so high the sky I scrape
Had my eyes peeled both wide open, and I got a glimpse
Of my innocence... got back my inner sense...
Baby got it, still got it"

Off He Goes,"Know a man
His face seemed pulled and tense
Like he's ridin' on a motorbike
In the strongest winds
So I approach with tact
Suggest that he should relax
But he's always movin' much too fast
Said he'll see me on the flip side
On this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been takin' too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
There he goes
He's yet to come back
But I seen his picture
It doesn't look the same up on the rack
We go way back
I wonder 'bout his insides
It's like his thoughts are too big for his size
He's been taken...where, I don't know
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
There he goes
And now I rub my eyes, for he has returned
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned
For he still smiles... And he's still strong
Nothing changed but the surroundin' bullshit
That has grown
And now he's home and we're laughin'
Like we did, my same old, same old friend
Until a quarter to ten
I saw the strain creep in
He seems distracted and I know just what is going to happen next
Before his first step, he's off again"
Habit,"See it happen to a couple of friends.
Seen it happen and the message it sends.
Takeing off for what's an obvious fall.
Just to see what all the fuss is about.
It's not your way.
Not your way.
It's not your way.
Another habit says it's in love with you.
Another habit says it's long overdue.
Another habit like an unwanted friend.
I'm so happy with my righteous self.
It's not your way.
Not your way.
It's not your way.

Red Mosquito,"(Line one, mighty fine.)
Watched from the window with a red mosquito.
I was not allowed to leave the room.
I saw the sun go down and now it's coming up.
Somewhere in the time between I was bitten.
Must have been the devil.
He was just paying me a little visit.
Reminding me of his presence.
Letting me know he's a-waiting. Ohh...
Red man's your neighbor. Call it behavior.
While you're climbing up slippery hills.
Two steps ahead of him. Punctures in your neck.
Hovering just above your bed.
Hovering just above your bed.
I was bitten must have been the devil.
He was just paying me a little visit.
Reminding me of his presence.
And letting me know he's a-waiting.

Lukin,"Drive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home.
I'll take a walk so I could curse my ass for being dumb.
I'll make a right, after the arches, stinking grease and bone.
Stopped at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog.
I'm going to Lukin's.
I've got a spot at Lukin's.
I knocked the door at Lukin's.
Open the fridge. Now I know life is worth.
I found the key but I return to find an open door.
Some fucking freak who claims I fathered, by rape, her own son.
I find my wife, I call the cops, this days work's never done.
The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun."
Present Tense,"Do you see the way that tree bends? Does it inspire
Leaning out to catch the sun's rays. A lesson to be applied.
Are you getting something out of this all encompassing trip?
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, ohh, or you can come to terms and realize you're the only one who can forgive yourself. Oh.
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense.
Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Checked your hands and studied the lines.
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light?
Seems that needlessly it's getting harder to find an approach and a way to live.
Are we getting something out of this all encompassing trip.
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, ohh, or you can come to terms and realize you're the only one who cannot forgive yourself. Oh, ohh.

Mankind,"You'll be going out with radio, going out with disco, going out like bacchanal.
I'll be going out with telephone, going out alone, to the radar zone.
It's all just inadvertent imitation. And I don't mean mine.
It's all across this nation.
If it's just inadvertent simulation. A pattern in all mankind.
What's got the whole world faking it?
I'll be playing with my magazine, using up my Listerine, like Ovaltine.
And you'll be dipping in your battleship, for the latest tip, for the latest dream.
It's all just inadvertent imitation. And I don't mean mine.

I'm Open,"A man lies in his bed in a room with no door.
He waits hoping for a presence, something, anything, to enter.
After spending half his life searching he still felt as blank as the ceiling at which he's staring.
He's alive but feels absolutely nothing. So is he?
When he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him, by nine he had deciphered the illusion trading magic for fact.
No tradebacks.
So this is what it's like to be an adult.
If he only knew now what he knew then...
I'm open,
I'm open,
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
I'm open,
I'm open,
Yeah... Woo...
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets and no covers he decides to dream.
Dream up a new self for himself."
Around the Bend,"I'm wishing you all well.
Mind a peace within your cell.
Covers up I cast you off.
I'll be watching as you breathe.
I lie still, you move, I send you off around the bend.
I hold your head deep in my arms.
My fingertips they close your eyes.
Off you dream my little child.
There's a sun around the bend.
There's a sun around the bend.
All evenings close like this.
All these moments that I've missed.
Please forgive me, won't you dear?
Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend.
You're an angel when you sleep.
How I want your soul to keep on, and on, around the bend."
Last Exit,"Lives opened and trashed
Look, ma, watch me crash
No time to question
Why'd nothing last
Grasp and hold on
Hold tight and fast
Soon be over
And I will relent
Let the ocean swell, dissolve 'way my past
Three days, and maybe longer
Won't even know I've left
Under your tongue
I'm like a tab
I will give you what
You're not s'posed to have
Under my breath
I swear by sin
For better or for worse
A best we begin
Let the sun climb, oh, burn 'way my mask
Three days, and maybe longer
Shed my skin at last
Shed, shed
Let the sun shine, burn 'way my mask
Three days, and maybe longer
Won't ever find me here
Let the ocean dissolve 'way my past
Four days, and not much longer
Let my spirit pass
This is, this is
This is, this is
This is, this is
My
Last exit"

Not for You,"Restless soul, enjoy your youth
Like Muhammad hits the truth
Can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, don't you do it too...too...
Small my table, a sits just two
Got so crowded, I can't make room
Oh, where did they come from? Stormed my room!
And you dare say it belongs to you...to you...

Oh, not for you...ah, you...

Ransom paid the Devil...He whispers pleasing words...
Triumphant are the angels if they can...a get there first...
Little secrets tremors...turned to quake...

Take my time...not my life...

I would rather starve than eat your bread...
I would rather run but I can't walk...
Guess I'll lie alone just like before...
I'll take the firmest path...oh, and I must refuse your test
Push me and I will resist...this behavior's not unique
I don't want to hear from those who know...
They can buy, but can't put on my clothes...
I don't want to limp for them to walk...
Never would have known of me before...
I don't want to be held in your debt...

Bugs,"All these...
I got bugs
I got bugs in my room
Bugs in my bed
Bugs in my ears
Their eggs in my head
Bugs in my pockets
Bugs in my shoes
Bugs in the way I feel about you
Bugs on my window
Trying to get in
They don't go nowhere
Waiting, waiting...
Bugs on my ceiling
Crowded the floor
Standing, sitting, kneeling...
A few block the door
And now the question's:
Do I kill them?
Become their friend?
Do I eat them?
Raw or well done?
Do I trick them?
I don't think they're dumb
Do I join them?
Looks like that's the one
I got bugs on my skin
Tickle my nausea
I let it happen again
They're always takin' over
I see they surround me, I see...
See them deciding my fate
Oh, that which was once...was once up to me...
Now it's too late
I got bugs in my room...one on one
That's when I had a chance
I'll just stop now
I'll become naked

Satan's Bed,"It's not all been said...been said and done...
I've never slept in Satan's bed
Although I must admit...still visits my place

Funny how I always want to give in
Sundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, Thursday, the same
Sometimes the special guest, he don't like to leave
Already...in love...
Already...in love...
Already...in love...

Who made, who made up, made up the myth
That we were born to be covered in bliss?
Who set the standard, born to be rich?
Such fine examples, skinny little bitch
Model, role model, roll some models in blood
Get some flesh to stick, so they look like us
I shit and I stink, I'm real, join the club
I'd stop and talk, but I'm already in love
Already...in love...

Never shook Satan's hand, look see for yourself
You'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off
I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both
Jump off a cliff, don't need your help so back off
I'll never suck Satan's dick...
Again, you'd see it, you know, right round the lips
I'll wait for an angel, but I won't hold my breath

Better Man,"Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she'd do it, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
She loved him
She don't want to leave this way
She feeds him
That's why she'll be back again

Dissident,"She nursed him there, ooh, over a night.
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay.
What to say? What to say?
But soon she was down. Soon he was low.
At a quarter past. A holy no.
She had to turn around.
When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded. A dissident is here.
Escape is never the safest path.
Oh, a dissidence. A dissident is here.
And to this day she's glided on.
Always home but so far away.
Like a word misplaced. Nothing said, what a waste.
But when she had contact with the conflict.
There was meaning but she sold him to the state.
She had to turn around.
When she couldn't hold she folded. A dissident is here.
Escape is never the safest path.
Oh, a dissidence. A dissident is here. Oh. Oh... Oh...
She gave him away when she couldn't hold. No, she folded.
A dissident is here.
Escape is never the safest path.
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here.
Oh, couldn't hold on. She couldn't hold. No, she folded. A dissident is here.

Rearviewmirror,"I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive
I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Pissed on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Clearer Clearer Once you, were in my rearviewmirror
I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away

Bare their gums when they moan and squeak.
Lick the dirt off a larger one's feet.
They don't push. Don't crowd.
Congregate until they're much too loud.
Fuck to procreate till they are dead.
Drink the blood of their so called best friend.
They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way.
Don't pack themselves together and run as one.
Don't shit where they're not supposed to.
Don't take what's not theirs. They don't compare.
They don't scam. Don't fight.
Don't oppress an equals given rights.

Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town,"I seem to recognize your face
Haunting familiar yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
I swear I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me you wouldn't recall, for I'm not my former
It's hard when, your stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all, small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream, hello
My god its been so long, never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are, and here I am
Hearts and thoughts they fade, away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade"

How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make, yeah...
I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction, and I won't change my mind

Hold On,"i was doom riding on top a black horse
whatever prize there was
i could only observe where the trouble starts
where does it end?
i cannot be cured
before it ends
i know life would be different if i held on (held on)
i know i could be something if i held on
gave her love away
put it in my pocket when it should've been framed
oh, it lost its shine
gotta get this out of my head
out of my brain
how could it end,
end like this?
how could it end?

Cready Stomp,[Instrumental]
Crazy Mary,"She lived on the curve in the road,
In an old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks
Sometimes on the way into town we'd say:
""Mama, can we stop and give her a ride?""
Sometimes we did,
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed, crazy Mary
Down a long dirt road, past the parson's place
That old blue car we used to race
Little country store
With a sign tacked to the side
Said 'No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G Allowed'
Underneath that sign
Always congregated quite a crowd
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
One night thunder cracked,
Mercy backed outside her window sill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees,
Over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung, newspaper-covered walls,
And Mary rising up above it all
Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields,
Into the house of Mary
That what you fear the most,
Could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most,
Could meet you halfway
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around"
Once,"I admit it, what's to say? Yeah
I'll relive it without pain, mmm
Back street lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes
I play
Once
Upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once
Upon a time
I could lose myself
Yeah
Oh, try and mimic what's insane, eh
I am in it, where do I stand? Uh
Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet
I pray
Once
Upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once
Upon a time
I could lose myself
Yeah
You think I got my eyes closed but I've been lookin' at you the whole fucking time
Ooh, once
Upon a time
I could control myself
Yeah
Once
Upon a time
I could lose myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Once
Upon a time
I could love myself
Yeah
Once
Upon a time
I could love you
Yeah

Even Flow,"Freezin' rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh Feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days
Oh hand out faces that he sees come again ain't that familiar
Oh dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane
Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh he don't know
So he chases them away
Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life again
Life again
Kneelin' looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its way, yeah
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame
Even flow

Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away
Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away
Him away, him away

Alive,"Son she said
Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy
Was nothin' but a fool
While you were sittin'
Home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him
But I'm glad we talked,
Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Oh she walks slowly
Across a young man's room
She said I'm ready, for you
I can't remember anything
To this very day
'Cept the look, yeah the look
Oh, you know where
Now I can't see, I just stare
I, I, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Is something wrong
She said
Of course there is
You're still alive
She said
Oh do I deserve to be?
And is that the question? Oh
And if so, if so
Who answers?
Who answers?
I, I, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Why Go,"She scratches a letter into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years, and counting, since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed by some stupid fuck, and mommy agrees,
yeah...
Whoa...yeah...hey yeah yeah...
Why go home...
Why go home...
Why go home...
She seems to be stronger, but what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend, she could join the game, boy
She could be another clone...ooh...whoa...ah yeah...
Ooh...
Why go home? Why go home? Why go home? Why go home? What you taught me...put me here...don't come visit...mother...
Sting me...
Whoa...ooh...

Black,"Hey, oh
Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did
All five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn
Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by
Some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So why do I sear
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
Round my head
I'm spinning
Oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away
And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures had
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am
All I'll be
Yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I hope you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why
Why
Why can't it be
Why can't it be mine"
Jeremy,"At home
Drawing pictures
Of mountain tops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a V
The Dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember
Pickin' on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
But we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth
And bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget
He hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting
Dropped wide open
Just like the day
Like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection
And the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Try to forget this,
Try to erase this,
From the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in
spoke in
Jeremy spoke in

Jeremy spoke in class today"
Oceans,"Hold on to the thread

To dream of the next

Running to, you didn't

Could have learned your voice one last time

Be my time, 'bout you?

Would you hit me?
Oh oh oh
Oh whoa whoa, oh
All the bills go by, and
Initiatives are taken up
By the middle, there ain't gonna be any middle any more
And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place, left the porch
Left the porch, oh oh oh

This could be the day
Hold my hand, walk beside me
I just need to say
Hear my name, take a good look

Deep,"On the edge windowsill
Ponders his maker, ponders his will
To the street below, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view
And he sinks a needle deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
On the edge of a know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior, the aged come
To the sky above, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view
And he sinks a burning knife deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
On the edge of a Christmas clean love
Young virgin from Heaven visiting Hell
To the man above her
She just ain't nothing
And she doesn't like the view

I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain release me

I'll open up release me, release me, release me, release me"
Soldier of Love,"Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Oh, lay down your arms and love me peacefully, yeah

Oh, there ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one who loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield
Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Ayy, lay down your arms and love me peacefully, yeah
Use your arms for squeezing and pleasing
That's the way it's gonna be

I Got Id,"My lips are shakin', my nails are bit off
Been a month since I heard myself talk
All the advantage this life's got on me
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea
And I fight back in my mind
Never lets me be right, oh
I got memories, I got shit
So much it don't show
I walked the line
When you held me in that night
I walked the line
When you held my hand that night
An empty shell seems so easy to crack
Got all these questions, don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie alone and wait for a dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're lookin' at me
And I'll stay in bed
Oh, blue eyes, I've seen him
If just once, I could feel loved
Oh, stare back at me, yeah
But I walked the line
When you held me in that night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held my hand that night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held me close that night
I paid the price
Never held you in real life
My lips are shakin'"
Long Road,"And I wished for so long, cannot stay
All the precious moments, I cannot stay
It's not like wings have fallen, I cannot stay
But without you something's missing, cannot say
Holding hands of daughters and sons
And their faiths are falling down, down, down, down
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today
Will I walk the long road? Cannot stay
There's no need to say goodbye
All the friends and family
All the memories going round, round, round, round
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today
And the wind are rollin'
And the sky keeps turning grey
And the sun is set
The sun will rise another day
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today
Will I walk the long road?

Flower,"Along her vain parade
Along her veins
All of seventeen
Eyes a purple green
Treated like a queen
She was on borrowed self-esteem
She would do her dance
A painful masquerade
Spinning you into her web
Along her vain parade
In her uniform
Studded brass and steel
Kissing napkin lipstick stains
And smearing sincerity
Along her vain parade
Along her veins
Time crept up on her
She's early gray
Her reflection looks concerned
And flowers hit her grave"
All Your Lies,"All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
See through your
Tripless, falling, limping, crawling,
Biting, fighting, back from dying
Endless ending, comprehending
Nothing of the sin she's sinning
Loosely buying your cheating, your lying
Will make it mine
While never crying
Corralled like a cat
With my head in a sack
And I feel like I'm tied to a railroad track"

To make a proper home, home
By overturning other stones, stones
Father, mighty man
Loves his little boys, boys
Shows them how to kill
To save his precious stones, stones

Deep into the ground, ground
Far beyond the wheel

Mood for Trouble,"My mood was in full swing
My mood was in full swing
I wanted to be free
Free to want so stale
I did not want to hear
The perfect thing to say
Dying to squeeze out
The ugly truth for everyone to hear
Admit
You believed
Your perfect pool of lies
And now
If you could say it
Everything would be all right
I did not wanna fight
I did not wanna kill
I wanted to be real
I wanted to believe
That I was not the only one alive"
Circle of Power,"The day will finally come and come and come

Covered with assholes

To see their fear and their trembling words
Of a prodigy
A pretty(?), pretty(?) blank name on the list
An ""x"" for every accomplished deed.
Ol' big bad ass circle of power's comin' to getcha!
(lots of screaming, mumbling)
Not necessarily dumb, but just uh...beautiful...beautiful...
Well it's the circle of power
And it's all
It's all the same
Ah the circle, spinning the circle of power
And it's under different names
Oh the circle of power
It's all the same

He did nothing quite well
He did nothing perfectly,
Much better than anyone I've ever seen
He did nothing all the time

He failed, and he failed miserably
He failed, and he failed quite bad
He failed, and he failed miserably
What's better he never even had to try"

Nazi Driver,"I don't care if it takes some time
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it right
Turn the head 360 degrees
Bite the hand that feeds
I don't care if it tastes like poison
Rip the legs from the thighs
Feed the prison, save the eyes
I don't care if it tastes like poison
I'm gonna feed the prison, feed the prison
Color in with lakes of red
Pile of bones for my bed
I'm gonna take some time
I'm gonna take some time
Hang your sides
To cure it right
Feed the prison, save the eyes
Not a tear will be shed
The only color is red... red
I don't care if it takes some time
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it right
Turn the head 360 degrees
Bite the hand that feeds
I don't care if it tastes like poison
Rip the legs from the thighs
Feed the prison, save the eyes
Not a tear will be shed
The only color is red
I don't care if it tastes like poison
I'm gonna feed the prison
I'm gonna feed the prison
I'm gonna feed"
Head Injury,"Head injury, head injury, head injury
You got a kiss for me, it hits me hard
You got a fist for me, you love so hard
My hands on my head, your words are like arrows
My hands on my head, there's permanent damage
Head injury, head injury, head injury
You got a kiss for me, it's sweet and frail
You got a fist for me, sure to impale
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows
My hand on my head, my mind growing narrow
Head injury"
Incessant Mace,"So he's afraid he'll suffer his father's fate
Two sets of silverware, cups and plates
Two burning hands and bleeding hearts
Don't feel it's not too late to start
Only the photographs on your wall
Are chained and down your hall
Reminding you of all the days
When you collected hell to pay
Well hell to pay
I said it's not too late
Not it's not too late
Incessant mace
Oh God I can see it, you know it's incessant mace
Leisure slacks and broken backs
Are what you get for piling stacks
Beneath your treasure chest
You wonder why you're under stress
No it's not too late
Incessant mace
Oh God I can see it, you know it's incessant mace"
One Minute of Silence,[Silence]
Rusty Cage,"You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to still water
And ride a pack of dogs
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Hits like a Phillips head into my brain
It's gonna be too dark to sleep again
Cutting my teeth on bars and rusty chains
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining icepicks on your steel shore
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run"
Outshined,"I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now
I just looked in the mirror
Things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California
And feeling Minnesota
So now you know, who gets mystified
Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling outshined
Someone let the dogs out
They'll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shedding
I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking
I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking
So now you know, who gets mystified
Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling outshined"
Slaves & Bulldozers,"Every word I said is what I mean
Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need
Virgin eyes and dirty looks
On what I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what's in it for me
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel
Buying lies and stealing jokes
And laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what's in it for me"
Jesus Christ Pose,"And you stare at me in your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me you don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me like I need to be saved
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud like it's the coming of the Lord
And I swear to you that I would never feed you pain
But you're staring at me like I'm driving the nails
In your Jesus Christ pose
And you stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out like it's the coming of the Lord
And would it pay you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Than to bury you poor
In your Jesus Christ pose"
Face Pollution,"I can count it on my fingers
I've got all my reasons not to feel
I'm numb as rigor mortis
Scared by monkey faces
Drowned in shark fins
But I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you
Now I'm in the mirror
Now it's getting clear
I fear that I'm in you
Now I'm into plastics
Now I've made a mask
It looks like fish heads
But I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you
Face pollution
Face pollution

Somewhere,"I wish to wish I dream to dream
I try to try and I live to live
And I die to die and I cry to cry
But I know why
Somewhere in my dreams
Things that should
Still the willow weeps
On roses for the dead
In laughs of love
From the likes of her
To the time of me
Like to moon to earth
Or the sky to sea
Only we're no longer
Allowed to be, to be
Somewhere in the dreams
Of those who should
Live in all the keeps
Echo all the worlds
In laughs of love
For times that pass my life
I'll search for the sky
That she wanders by
Somewhere in the dreams
That the skies hold
Still the willow weeps
On roses for her bed
In laughs of love"
Searching With My Good Eye Closed,"Painted blue across my eyes
And tied the linen on
And I'm on my way
Looking for the paradigm
So I can pass it off
Is it on my side
Is to the sky
Looking to the sky and down
Searching for a ground
With my good eye closed
If I took you for a ride
Would you take it wrong
Or would you make it right
Looking for a pedestal
That I can put you on
And be on my way
Is it to the sky
Looking to the sky and down
Searching for a ground
With my good eye closed
Stop you're trying to bruise my mind
I can do it on my own
Stop you're trying to kill my time
It's been my death since I was born
I don't remember half the time
If I'm hiding or I'm lost
But I'm on my way"
Room A Thousand Years Wide,"Listen, hear, he is inside
One who lives while others lie
I close my eyes and walk a thousand years
A thousand years that aren't mine
It seems he's near me as I walk
One who loved what love denied
He lives these years that I walk blind
All these years cannot be mine
Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow
A thousand doors a thousand lies
Rooms a thousand years wide
He walks in the cold sun and wind
All these years will not begin
Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow"
Mind Riot,"I was slipping through the cracks of a stolen jewel
I was tightrope walking in two ton shoes
Now somebody is talking about a third world war
And the police said this was normal control
And the candle was burning yesterday
Like somebody's best friend died
And I've been caught in a mind riot
I was crying from my eye teeth and bleeding from my soul
And I sharpened my wits on a dead man's skull
I built an elevator from his bones
Had to climb to the top floor just to stamp out the coals
And the candle was burning yesterday
Like somebody's best friend died
And I've been caught in a mind riot
I'm tied within
I'm luck's last match struck
In the pouring down wind"
Drawing Flies,"Sitting here like uninvited company
Wallowing in my own obscenities
I share a cigarette with negativity
Sitting here like wet ashes
With exes in my eyes and drawing flies
Bathed in perspiration drowned my enemies
Used my inspiration for a guillotine
I fire a loaded mental cannon to the page
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes
With exes in my eyes, and drawing flies
Hey what you yelling
About, conditions, permission, mirrored self affliction
Hey what you yellin' about sadists'
Co-addiction, perfect analogies
Hey what you yellin' about conditions
Permission mirrored self affliction
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride
Sitting here like wet ashes with exes in my eyes
And drawing flies"
Holy Water,"Holy water on the brain and I'm losing sleep
Holy bible on the night stand next to me
As I'm raped by another monkey circus freak
Trying to take my indignance away from me
Holy water is rusting me
Bloody murder is the best I've heard her scream
Holy devil in the flesh some might believe
And they take thine majesty so seriously
It's the big lies that are more likely to be believed
Holy water is rusting me
Damn the water if it's life you want to drink
Mind your mother if it makes you feel at ease
As you're raped by another monkey circus freak
It's the big lies that are more likely to be believed"

Hunted Down,"They saw you today as you were leaving
Now they run to hunt you down
Dogs lead the chase and you are bleeding
They run to hunt you down
Your narrow escape
Has wiped the smile right from your face
Those starved dogs howling
Run to hunt you down
As they run, hunt you down
You smile as you look in the mirror
Tears have left your eyes
Your face has a different exterior
Permanent disguise
Your narrow escape
Has wiped the smile right from your face
Those starved dogs howling
Run to hunt you down
As they run, hunt you down right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now"

Tears to Forget,"These tears to remember
These tears to forget
When I try to cry one
These tears do forget you

Its love and its beauty

When I try to cry one
These tears they do forget you

Nothing to Say,"Someone says my words are out of balance
Nothing to say, you got nothing to say
Dying words I bury everyday
Nothing to say, I've got nothing to say, nothing but the one thing
You've got nothing to say, nothing to say
Big bad words, spell it with four letters
Nothing to say, you got nothing to say
Oh God, your words are out of balance
Nothing to say, you got nothing to say, nothing but the one thing
Nothing, nothing
You've got nothing, nothing to say
Nothing but the one thing

Little Joe,"Little Joe, run for the border
Leave your home, leave your mother and father
Go to where the reptiles roam
On the side of the border that is your home
Little Joe, eyes of your lover look back on you
As you run for cover
Those sticks and fire, sticks and fire, won't break your bones
It is a lie
Little Joe, just like your father
Your eyes will water, your guts will splatter
Those sticks and fire, sticks and fire, won't break your bones
It is a lie
Litle Joe, run for the border
Leave your whole home, leave your mother and father
Go to where the reptiles roam
They're waiting for you little Joe
Little Joe run for the border

Hand of God,"(preacher speaking)
Now I would like friends if this evening
We should stand there with all other of God's
Creatures on the curbstone and watch this
March of time. Let us take our stand with them
And as we stand there I here one of them whispering
He is a Hebrew sage, he says 'vanity of vanities the
whole thing is a vain parade. It has no meaning'
(end preacher speaking)
The hand of God lays high above me
I'll be so good if you really love me
Let me feel your mighty crunch
As you rub me out like water, fire, coal, etc.
Let it be known today, if you got two hands
You're supposed to pray
Fingers of fire, coal, and lead
Fondly love me 'til I'm dead
The hand of God is thick and callous
Bruised and torn from stones and sticks
The hand of God has got a ring about the size of Texas
Made of sweet, smelly stuff
My fingers never smell
Let me try on your hand and see if it fits
Don't worry I won't touch anything unholy with it
Let it be known today, if you got two hands
You're supposed to pray"
Sub Pop Rock City,"I'm not stoned but I wanted to tell ya

Kingdom of Come,"So you think I got something on you?
I bet I know what you're gonna do
I'm asking me and talking blue
Fill your head
With crazy sounds
It ain't as pretty coming out

Been Away Too Long,"You can't go home, no I swear you never can
You can walk a million miles and get nowhere
I got no where to go ever since I came back
Just filling in the lines for the holes, and the cracks
(Yeah)
No one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
I've been away for too long
This place has a special kind of falling apart
Like they put the whole thing together in the dark
No one knows where the edge of the knife is
And no one knows where intelligent life is
(Yeah)
No one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I've been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I've been away for too long
I've been away for too long
I've been away for too long
Kilos, through key holes
Widows, through windows
Pilots, through eyelets
Everyone is silent
Tankards and flagons and snifters and flutes on my way home
But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I've been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I've been away -- But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I've been away for too long

By Crooked Steps,"I'm addicted to feeling
Stealing love isn't stealing
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
I'm a walking believer
I'm a ghost and a healer
I'm the shape of the hole inside your heart
Not looking for a brighter side
Crooked steps will take me higher
I don't care if you want to cry
I'm a soldier for hire
Killing all you admire
And you live in the cloud but that will change
Not looking for a brighter side
Crooked steps will take me higher
I don't care if you want to cry
Blood raining down
Cuts a deep, deep river
And we're diving
And we're diving
By crooked steps
Right behind you
By crooked steps
Right behind you
I'm a walking believer
I'm a ghost and a healer
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
By crooked steps

A Thousand Days Before,"Life
A thousand days ago
I was
Sinking in a hole
Try(ing)
To melt into the walls
Now
I am here inside the bowl
Here in the cold
Where no one stayed behind me
Now
A thousand days have gone
Again
Like the sun and moon at war
And
Give or take a thousand more
Here in the cold
Where no one stayed behind me
I’ll be on my own side
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
Here in the cold
Where no one stayed beside me
I’ll be on my own side
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
Born
With a thousand little holes
And
A tear to fill up every one
A thousand to ignore
I’ll be on my own side
I’ll be on my own side
I’ll be on my own side"
Blood On The Valley Floor,"Mountains all around
All together we stumble
Eleven million clowns
Every one with a razor out
And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill some more
Once we were the end
The end of the long road
Leading to the start
Of the ever-invading crowds
And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill
Endless summer, needless space
Fill it all up with a void
Mountains all around
Altogether we tumble down
And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill some more"
Bones Of Birds,"Time is my friend 'til it ain't and runs out
And that is all that I have 'til it's gone
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth
Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive probably... maybe
Try to look out through a hole in a bag
Circle above looking down, bird of prey
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth
Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive probably... maybe
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth
Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive probably
Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned

Taree,"Though I can’t put my hands on you
I can feel you now
In the bones and the blood flowing
Needles on the ground
In the ether I sail to you
Floating on the fumes
Run aground on the shore for you
Simple wreckage
Taree walk out and raise the road
To my tilted shadow
I only know I made it home
When I drown
In your ghost light
Though I can’t put a name on you
I will cry it out
In my heart I will hold what my
Bloody hands have dropped
Run aground all on the floor for you
Simple wreckage
Taree walk out and raise the road
To my tilted show
I only know I made it home
When I drown
In your ghost light
Taree walk out and raise the road
To my tilted show
I only know I made it home
When I drown

Attrition,"Lay here on the bombastic gloom
Parade of ghouls marches by
Headed down to Nero's tomb
Raising flags and burning rights
We're home, is up, I got, made fire
And I’ll be young spinning eyes
Laugh it out on the bottomless skies
A victim's smile never lies
You have always lived your life like a joke
With no time
What you gonna do about it
'til you get the punch line right
On the cliff above stormy waves
Can’t decide to climb or drown
Others falling down, disgrace
On your thumbs, over-written
The ladder is poisoned, have to find a new way around
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
You always lived your life like a joke with no time
You always lived your life like a joke with no time"
Black Saturday,"Promise something
Kill me right away if I start to get slow
Don't remember
How to separate the one from the apple
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
Kill me right away if I start to listen
To the voices
Telling all the mouths that they need to swallow
Too bad for me
It's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid
I would do the same for you
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing
'Til I'm born again
I was thirsty
I remember that you gave me some water
I was angry
Everything you want, you gave me no trouble
I was crying
I remember that you gave me your shoulder
Too bad for me
It's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid
I would do the same for you
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing
'Til I'm born again
Born again
Too bad for me
It's the least that you can do

Halfway There,"I woke up with my feet nailed down
And my head moving the speed of sound
Had a dream I was caught in a maze
And I couldn't find my way back out
Some were born to move mountains around
And some to rot away in jail
I can admit that when I am scratching
Everything can go to hell
And how far is halfway there?
I didn't see you on the trail now
We've almost become good enough
Should the good life be so hard?
Is that what our dreams have become?
Sometimes, when you're shooting an arrow
It can fly across the sky so proud
Well I would go all the way to the sun
If I didn't have to come back down
And how far is halfway there?
I didn't see you on the trail now
We've almost become good enough
Should the good life be so hard?
Is that what our dreams have become?
Have become
Yeah
If you got a car and somewhere to sleep
Someone who loves you and something to eat
I would say you're doing better than most
But maybe not as well as some
And how far is halfway there?
I didn't see you on the trail now
We've almost become good enough
Should a good life be so hard won?
Is that what our dreams have become?
Is that what our dreams have become?"
Worse Dreams,"Let it swirl around you now
And let it fall apart
Put it back again
And find every piece
But it's not the same
And you never
can be sure just
How it looked
when you started
Turn around again now
And do it all over and over
Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone
Worse dreams are born
Everybody in, sit down
and keep on
holding on
Pull your arms around
Black clouds drown
And the rain is walking
Body in the ground by now
Down seven feet
and rolling
Hanging on the tail of
The sunrise til
You can't let go
Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone
Worse dreams are born
Like a doll from a sad dream
When it's gone
Worse dreams are born"
Eyelid's Mouth,"In the eyelid's mouth
On the iris tongue
When a scream crawls out
Only the tear has won
Only the tear has won
Who let the water run down? (Cry internal)
Who let the river run dry? (Live internal)
Who let the water run out? (Burn internal)
Who let the river run wild? (Die internal)
Who let the water run down? (Cry internal)
Who let the river run dry?
Through the eyelet comes
Unimagined light
Unremembered sun
Only the rivers run
But never hide
Who let the water run down? (Cry internal)
Who let the river run dry? (Live internal)
Who let the water run out? (Burn internal)
Who let the river run wild? (Die internal)
Who let the water run down? (Cry internal)

Rowing,"Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
gotta row
Moving is breathing
And breathing is life
Stopping is dying
You'll be alright
Life is a hammer
Waiting to drop
The boats in the shallows
But the rowing won't stop
Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
gotta row
Can't see the sky
Nothing on the horizon
Can't feel my hands
And the water keeps rising
Can't fall asleep
Cause I'll wake up dead
I just keep on pulling
I just keep on rolling
Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
gotta row
Rowing is living
And living is hard
But living beats losing
All that we are
And all that we know of
And all that we feel
And all we remember
Imagined or real
I heard an echo
But the answer had changed
from the word
I remember that I started out saying
Living is cheating
If you're not pulling oars
But the current is leaving
I'll get mine, you'll get yours
Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
gotta row
Rowing is bleeding
And bleeding is breathing
Breathing is feeling
burning or freezing
Keep getting dirty
But I started out clean
Keep on pulling
I keep on pulling
I keep on rolling
I keep on rolling
I keep on rolling
Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
gotta row"
Pretty Noose,"I caught the moon today
Pick it up
And throw it away all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love
With a dirty feel all right
Fallout and take the bait
Eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight
Common ruse dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't like
What you got me hanging from
Let your motor race
Pick it up
And get this mother gone
Out from and far away
The wooden stake
This thing has got me on
Diamond rope silver chain
Pretty noose is pretty pain
And I don't like
What you got me hanging from
I don't care what you got
I don't care what you need
I don't want anything
And I don't like what
You got me hanging from"
Rhinosaur,"Standing with my enemies
Hung on my horns
With haste and reverie
Killing with charm
Only happy when you hurt
Only deadly in a swarm
Only healthy in the dirt
Only empty in your arms
I play, I'm sick and tame
Drawing the hordes
I wait, and show the lame
The meaning of harm
The skulls beneath my feet
Like feathers in sand
I graze among the graves
A feeling of peace
Only bending when you break
Only feeding when you're cold
Only healing when you ache
Only feeling when you don't"
Zero Chance,"I think I know the answer
I stumbled on and all the world
Fell down
And all the sky went silent
Cracked like glass and slowly
Tumbled to the ground
They say if you look hard
You'll find your way back home
Born without a friend
And bound to die alone
I'm thinking of your highness
And crying long upon the loss
I've found
And on the plus and minus
Zero chance of ever
Turning this around
Why doesn't anyone believe
In loneliness
Stand up and everyone will see
Your holiness
Why doesn't anyone believe
In loneliness
Stand up and everyone will see
Your holiness
They say if you look hard
You'll find your way back home
Born without a friend
And bound to die alone"
Dusty,"I think it's turning back around
And I think I like it
I think it's turning back around
Though I don't know why it is
I think it's turning back on me
I'm down on the upside
I think it's turning back on me
Now I'm the good ride
And nothing's gonna put me out
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around
I think it's coming on the wind
Just like you said it
I think it's coming on the wind
And I'm gonna let it
I think it's turning back on me
Everything's easy
I think it's turning back on me
Everything's real to me"
Ty Cobb,"I'm sittin' in a magic hat
With smoke and mirrors
And tire rubber fires
Watch me disappear
What made it slow you down
Sucking on a ball and chain
Another motherfucker goes down the drain
Hard headed fuck you all
Just add it up to the hod rod death toll
Sick in the head sick in the mouth
And I can't hear a word you say
Not a bit, and I don't give a shit
I got the glass, I got the steel
I got the love to hate
All I need is your head on a stake
Hard headed fuck you all
Just add it on the hot rod death toll"
Blow Up The Outside World,"Nothing seems to kill me no matter how hard I try
Nothing is closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight
And nothing seems to break me
No matter how hard I fall nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up though not invincible I know
I've givin' everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and
Blow up the outside world
Someone tried to tell me something
Don't let the world get you down
Nothing will do me in before I do myself
So save it for your own and the ones you can help
Want to make it understood
Wanting though I never would
Trying though I know it's wrong
Blowing it to hell and gone
Wishing though I never could
Blow up the outside world"
Burden In My Hand,"Follow me into the desert
As thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth
And drown in alcohol
Cause down below the truth is lying
Beneath the riverbed
So quench yourself and drink the water
That flows below her head
Oh no there she goes
Out in the sunshine the sun is mine
I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
Close your eyes and bow your head
I need a little sympathy
Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
Who isn't me
Kill your health and kill yourself
And kill everything you love
And if you live you can fall to pieces
And suffer with my ghost
I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
I left her in the sand, just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me
Just a burden in my hand
Just another anchor on my heart
Just a tumor in my head
And I'm in the dark
So follow me into the desert
As desperate as you are
The moon is glued to a picture of heaven
And all the little pigs have gone
Oh no there she goes
Out in the sunshine the sun is mine
Sun is mine
I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
I left her in the sand, just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me
Would you cry for me"
Never Named,"I had a dog he was a mix
He loved me like a God
But I was just a kid
The kind mother likes
Now I'm big like the sky
And I'm down sized inside
I'll put this all to rest
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm getting all depressed
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I got my father's sense
And my big brother's pants
And I look like a man
And I feel like an ant
Just a speck on the ground
Growing like a weed
A fleck of a seed
I'll put my hand in flames
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
Feels like I'm born again
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
And I'll keep hanging from your hair
And I'll keep playing in the sand
Just as long as I can"
Applebite,"No one can save
The pure or the brave
No one can save them at all
Grow and decay
Grow and decay
It's only forever
Loosely or tightly
Everything fits
Even the wrists on your arm
Grow and decay
Grow and decay
It's only forever"
Never The Machine Forever,"I can't live when it lives
It won't live if I die
Machine has no heart to give
Heart it takes could be mine
Come on
Come down
Come out from where you hide
Follows me down the river
Shadows me through the sky
A sideways glance in the mirror
Stalemate machine in a tie
Come on
Come down
Come out from where you hide
Get up
Get off
Get on with your life
Forever means all is not seen
Never means forever brings everything
I fashion will and desire
Always I and I survive
Mercurial mind the fire
Ferrivorous direction and drive
Come on
Come down
Come out from where you hide
Get up
Get off
Get on with your life
Presently, I see myself clearer
Why time I visualize
I spy device in the mirror
Checkmate watch machine die"
Tighter & Tighter,"Shadow face
Blowing smoke and talking wind
Lost my grip
Fell too far to start again
A sudden snake
Found my shape and tells the world
Remember this
Remember everything is just black
Or burning sun
And I hope it's a sweet ride
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me I'm gone
Warm and sweet
Swinging from a windows ledge
Tight and deep
One last sin before I'm dead
A sucking holy wind
Will take me from this bed tonight
And bloody wits
Another hits me and I have to say goodbye
And I hope it's a sweet ride
Here for me tonight
Cause I feel I'm going
Feel I'm slowing down"
No Attention,"I've got war on my mind blood on my hands
And love on my head
So open your hands open your mouth
Let it be said
You know I've got it mad in my mind
Don't waste my time it's not going to change
So say what you want spit it out loud
Into my face
And I'll pay no attention
They're gonna tell you where to walk
When to smile and just what to say
They say have your own fun
Make your own mind
And don't make no waves
But if you got a handful of change
Don't throw it away it's gonna come
So say what you want, suck all my
Suck on my brain
And I'll pay no attention"
Switch Opens,"Hey you slave, go hang your owners
Draw your names among their ashes
Lay your children on their thrones
Gather 'round and fall right down
Here at sundown nothing is when
Everything is all right
Switch opens
Opening around and let's the garden rise
Switch is on
Hey, you patients
Where's your surgeon
Left with your
Insides open
Left your heart out
On the table
Gather 'round and fall right down
Feel the air now
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine
Switch opens
Opening around and let's the garden rise
Switch is on"
Overfloater,"Come on in and take me on an override
Been stuck inside and up all night at Dave's
Now trouble's far away, and mother in her cage
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine
I want to make it right
Close the door and pull the shades
And climb the walls
Feel medicine heal the lines of age
I'm here and now I'm gone
I'm there and far beyond
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine
Nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine
I want to make it right
I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretense over the (spire) why
On and connected I'm over floating now
I'm over floating alone
Breathe and take it in and gently blow it out
Drink it down and swallow hard again
Hold the potion up
Stare your shadow down
Remember to forget and then rename your shame
I want to make it right
I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretense over the (spire) why
On and connected I'm over floating now
I'm over floating alone"
An Unkind,"We see the vipers of distance
Crawl into our lives everyday
Breeding our Edens of hatred
Pathetically stupid and unkind
We couldn't look a saint in the eyes
On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go
Marching in lines of contradiction
Forgetting the history we make
Loving our hangmen as the
Penultimate joke
We lack the Moses...to look
A saint in the eye"
Boot Camp,"I must obey the rules
I must be tame and cool
No staring at the clouds
I must stay on the ground
In clusters of the mice
The smoke is in our eyes
Like babies on display
Like angels in a cage
I must be pure and true
I must contain my views
There must be something else
There must be something good
Far away"
Let Me Drown,"Stretch the bones over my skin
Stretch the skin over my head
I'm going to the holy land
Stretch the marks over my eyes
Burn the candles deep inside
Yeah you know where I'm coming from
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
Slip down the darkness to the mouth
Damn the water burn the wine
I'm going home for the very last time
So throw it away, you don't have to take me
Make no mistakes I'm what you make me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
I see you turn around and burning down
The feeling starts to sink
I feel the hurt surround me
Please dissolve me
She's resolved to be
Heal my wounds without a trace
Seal my tomb without my face
I'm going to the lonely place
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you"
My Wave,"Take, if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels alright
Break, if you like the sound
If it gets you up
If it brings you down
Share, if it makes you sleep
If it sets you free
If it helps you breathe
Don't come over here
And piss on my gate
Save it just keep it
Off my wave
Cry, if you want to cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Pray, if you want to pray
If you like to kneel
If you like to lay
Don't come over here
And piss on my gate
Save it just keep it
Off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave

Cry, if you want to cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave

If you want a piece
If it feels alright

And piss on my gate
Save it just keep it
Off my wave

Fell On Black Days,"Whatsoever I've feared has come to life
And whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when everyday seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded, now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days
Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
Search my soul they say
But I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking when I get it right
When I get it right
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days
How would I know
That this could be my fate?
How would I know
That this could be my fate? Yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
So what you wanted to see good
Has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours
Has made it mine
So don't you lock up something
That you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking
No, not tying, no, not tying
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Yeah, I sure don't mind, sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

Mailman,"Hello don't you know me
I'm the dirt beneath your feet
The most important fool you forgot to see
I've seen how you give it
Now I want you to receive
I'm sure that you would do the same for me
I know I'm headed for the bottom
But I'm riding you all the way
For all of your kisses turned to spit in my face
For all that reminds me which is my place
For all of the times when you made me disappear
This time I'm sure you will know that I'm here
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
But I'm riding you all the way
But I'm riding you all the way
But I'm riding you all the way
But I'm riding you all the way
Riding! Riding away
My place was beneath you but now I'm above
And now I send you a message of love
A simple reminder of what you won't see
A future so holy without me
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the . . .
But I'm riding you all the way
Yeah I'm riding you all the way
A-riding you all the way
Oh I'm riding you
Yes I'm riding you!
I'm-a riding you!
Yes I'm riding you!
Oh I'm riding you all the way"
Superunknown,"If this isn't what you see
It doesn't make you blind
If this doesn't make you feel
It doesn't mean you've died
Where the river's high
Where the river's high
If you don't want to be seen
You don't have to hide
If you don't want to believe
You don't have to try
To feel alive
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind
And then it steals your soul
If this doesn't make you free
It doesn't mean you're tied
If this doesn't take you down
It doesn't mean you're high
If this doesn't make you smile
You don't have to cry
If this isn't making sense
It doesn't make it lies
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind
And then it steals your soul
Get yourself afraid
Get yourself alone
Get yourself contained
Get yourself control
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind
And then it steals your... soul"
Head Down,"I see that smile
I see that smile
I see that smile on your face

We see you dance

We see you cry
We turn your head
Then we slap your face
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down with your life

Black Hole Sun,"In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear"
Spoonman,"Feel the rhythm with your hands
Steal the rhythm while you can, Spoonman
Speak the rhythm on your own
Speak the rhythm all alone, Spoonman
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
All my friends are Indians
All my friends are brown and red, Spoonman
All my friends are skeletons
They beat the rhythm with their bones,

Feel the rhythm with your hands
Steal the rhythm while you can, Spoonman

Limo Wreck,"Tears of the feeble, hands of the slaves
Skin of the mothers, mouths of the babes
Building the towers, belongs to the sky
When the whole thing comes crashing down
Don't ask me why
Under the shelf, the shelf of the sky
Two eyes, two suns, too heavenly blinds
Swallowing rivers, belongs to the sea
When the whole thing washes away
Don't run to me
I'll be going down for the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the gold
And the wreck of you
Is the death of you all
And the wreck of you
Is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the death of you all
I'm the wreck of you

Heroes in stretches inch to the site
Blowing the pieces, belong to the wind
When the whole thing blows away
I won't pretend
I'll be going down for the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the souls
And the wreck of you
Is the death of you all
And the wreck of you
Is the break and the fall

The Day I Tried To Live,"I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said seize the day, pull the trigger, drop the blade
And watch the rolling heads
The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggar's change
And gave it to the rich
The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch yeah
Singing, one more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
The day I tried to live
Words would you say
Never seem to live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud with all the other pigs
Singing, one more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
The day I tried to live, live
I tried
I woke the same as any other day you know
I should have stayed in bed
The day I tried to win
I wallowed in the blood and mud with all the other pigs
And I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
Singing one more time around
(Might do it)
One more time around

One more time around

One more time around (might make it)
The day I tried to live, live
Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
One more time around"
Kickstand,"Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
My mother says that it's alright
My mother says that's the only life
So do it right
Do it right

Come stand me up
Kickstand, I got saddle made of leather
Kickstand, I got the words to come together
I got the urge to ride your trike
My mother says that's the only life"
Fresh Tendrils,"Long time coming
It seemed to take me through
Long time coming
Many served the few
And long to taste the shame
That bows down before you
Long time coming
It seemed to get me by
Long time coming
It seemed to satisfy
You longed to taste the shame
That everybody tries
Shame shame throw yourself away
Give me little bits of more than I can take
If it sits upon your tongue or naked in your eyes
Give me little bits of more than I can try
Long time coming
It seemed to take me through
Long time coming
Many served the few
And long to taste the shame
That bows down before you
Shame shame throw yourself away
Give me little bits of more than I can take
If it sits upon your tongue or naked in your eyes
Give me little bits of more than I can try"
4th Of July,"Shower in the dark day
Clean sparks diving down
Cool in the waterway
Where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun
Breathing life like fire
Thought I was the only one
But that was just a lie
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July
Pale in the flare light
The scared light cracks and disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares
The fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it
Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July
Now I'm in control
Now I'm in the fall out
Once asleep but now I stand
And I still remember
Your sweet everything
Light a roman candle
And hold it in your hand
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July"
Half,"When I hand my love in
I'll be done
A handed glove
Hides the door
Half a chance
Half a chance
We still
Have a chance
Mr. Full, Mr. Have
Kills Mr. Empty Hand
Half a chance
Half a chance
We still
Have a chance"
Like Suicide,"Heard it from another room
Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide
Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck lays my broken gift
Just like suicide
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her, finish her
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide
Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide
Yeah
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her finish her
With eyes of blood and bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel, oh
I feel for you
Ah ah yeah (I feel, I feel)
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide"
Ugly Truth,"You hide your eyes
But the ugly truth
Just loves to give it away
You gave yourself
If you were mine to give
I might throw it away
You share but money can't give
What the truth takes away
Throw it away
I painted my eyes
Ugly isn't what I want to see
I painted my mind
Ugly isn't what I want to be
I don't mind but the truth
Don't look that good on me
Throw it away
I don't think I really
Understand you
And I can't see why
I'd ever want to
And even if it isn't mine to say
I'll say it anyway
It's ugly
If you were mine to give
I might throw it away
But money can't give
What the truth takes away
Throw it away"
Hands All Over,"Hands all over the Eastern border
You know what? I think we're falling from composure
Hands all over Western culture
Ruffling feathers and turning eagles into vultures
Yeah, into vultures
Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother
Gonna kill your mother
Kill your mother, and I love her
Yeah, I love her
Hands all over the coastal waters
The crew men thank her
Then lay down their oily blanket
Hands all over the inland forest
In a striking motion trees fall down
Like dying soldiers
Yeah, like dying soldiers
Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother
Gonna kill your mother
Kill your mother, and I love her
Yeah, I love her
Hands all over the peasant's daughter
She's our bride
She'll never make it out alive
Hands all over the words I utter
Change them into what you want to
Like balls of clay
Put your hands away
Yeah, put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother
Gonna kill your mother
And I love her
And she loves me"
Gun,"I got an idea of something we can do with a gun
Sink load and fire till the empire
Reaps what they've sown
Shoot shoot shoot till their minds are open
Shoot shoot shoot till their eyes are closed
Push push push till we get some motion
Push push push till the bombs explode
I got an idea
We can do it
All on our own
Nothing to worry
Regret must weigh a ton
Kick kick kick till the laws are broken
Kick kick kick till the boots are worn
Hit hit hit till the truth is spoken
Hit hit hit till the truth is born"
Power Trip,"I want to be
A cowboy star upon the screen
Oh hey and I want to drive
My cowboy car across the scene
Oh hey and I want to write
The magazines housewives read
And I want to be
In control of everything
I want to be King
I want to make the toys
You buy for Christmas Eve
Yeah and I want to be
The father of the ethnic child
Who stars on T.V.
Oh yeah and I, I want to write
The magazines that housewives read
Oh hey and I want all the leaders
Of the Third World
To answer to me
I want to be King
I want to be King
So maybe now the Pope
Will bow and kiss my ring
I wanna be king"
Get On The Snake,"Get on the snake
With a swarm of motor flies
Get on the snake
Under the Cola colored sky
Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Get on the snake
Where the metal river bleeds
Get on the snake
Where you never will believe
Hey baby, what's your disease
My heart's bleeding
I'm dying to leave
Get on the snake
Where the water turns to steam
Get on the snake
With a suicide machine
Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean...
Hungry and mean..."
Full On Kevin's Mom,"You don't get nothing for free
Kev & me were two of three
Three brothers to the end
Then one went full on Kevin's mom
Now things have changed
Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on
You don't get nothing for free
And this one took the long way
This one took the hard road
I ain't saying who
But it wasn't me
We were three
Kevin's mom made four
(We don't come around anymore)"
Loud Love,"There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf and now I want noise
You stay down
But I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
If you've got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well I know
But that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pull
Well that's right
I want something to explode
I've been deaf
Now I want noise"
I Awake,"Woke up depressed
I left for work
You have a good day
It's not your fault
I know it hurts
Remember, I love you, love you
Remember, I love you, love you
I love
Woke up depressed
I left for work
You have a good day
It's not my fault
I know it hurts"
No Wrong No Right,"Watch for vipers and poison snakes
Feeling fingers make no mistake
Grabbing that pull your hair
Stealing everything there, everything
Restless widow in the dark
Carelessly looks for a spark
Near the trap fate rears its head
No hesitation, victim dead
Just from the start it's the end
And it's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
Spider moving up your wall
To the ceiling he slowly crawls
Weaves a web above your bed
Egg that cracks falls on your head
And it's all the same
It's all the same
No hesitation, victim dead
Just from the start it's the end
No wrong no right or guilt admission
It's all the same
You've been bitten, you've been bitten"
Uncovered,"Small creature are you
Small creature you are
How quickly you are uncovered
Naked and cold
Mumbling and crying
Knowing everything's been discovered
Many secrets have you
Many secrets you have
But it's only a matter of time
Did you finally decide
There's nowhere to hide
And really no reason why
Hey Mr. Shame
Have you got a name
I don't feel like calling you Buddy
I don't want to hear your story
I don't want to hear why
And I don't even care if you're sorry
Many secrets have you
Many secrets you have
But it's only a matter of time
Did you finally decide
There's nowhere to hide
And really no reason why
Strong is your body
Strong are your bones
Strong as your bloody lie is uncovered
Small creature are you
Small creature you are
How quickly you are uncovered
Naked and cold
Mumbling and crying
Knowing everything's been discovered"
Big Dumb Sex,"Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway
I've been looking for a reject
And you ain't had nothing like me yet
Don't you think it's time for motion
I can take what you've been pushin'
Hey I know what to do
I'm gonna fuck fuck fuck fuck you
Fuck you
Ya I know what to do
I'm gonna fuck fuck fuck fuck you
Fuck you I'm gonna
I'm the beast and you're the master
You're the meat of the matter
I'm no fool for discretion
When it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway"
Full On,"Yeah
Oh
Full on (yeah)
Full on, full on
Kevin's mom (full on)
Full on
Mommy! Hey!
Full on
Sing me to sleep, yeah
Sing me to sleep, full on
Full on, full on
Kevin's Mom
Yeah, Mommy! Mommy!
Full on
Woo!
Hey, yeah, hey, oh
(Full on)"
