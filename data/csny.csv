Chicago (CSNY),"Though your brother's bound and gagged And they've chained him to a chair Won't you please come to Chicago Just to sing In a land that's known as freedom How can such a thing be fair Won't you please come to Chicago For the help that we can bring We can change the world Re-arrange the world It's dying ... to get better Politicians sit yourself down There's nothing for you here Won't you please come to Chicago For a ride Don't ask Jack to help you 'Cause he'll turn the other ear Won't you please come to Chicago Or else join the other side We can change the world Re-arrange the world It's dying ... if you believe in justice It's dying ... and if you believe in freedom It's dying ... let a man live his own life It's dying ... rules and regulations, who needs them Throw 'em out the door Somehow people must be free I hope the day comes soon Won't you please come to Chicago Show your face From the bottom of the ocean To the mountains on the moon Won't you please come to Chicago No one else can take your place"
Find the Cost of Freedom,Find the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body down Find the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body down
King Midas in Reverse,If you could only see me And know exactly who I am You wouldn't want to be me Oh I can assure you of that I'm not the guy to run with 'Cause I'll throw you off the line I'll break you and destroy you Given time He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse It's plain to see it's hopeless Going on that way we are So even though I lose you You'd be better of by far He's not the one to hold your trust Everything around him turns to dust in his hand Nothing he can do is right He'd even like to sleep at night But he can't He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse I wish someone would find me And help me gain control Before I lose my reason and my soul He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse
Medley,"He's a perfect stranger Like a cross of himself and a fox He's a feeling arranger And a changer of the ways he talks He's the unforeseen danger The keeper of the key to the locks Know when you see him Nothing can free him Step aside, open wide It's the loner If you see him in the subway He'll be down at the end of the car Watching you move Until he knows, he knows who you are When you get off at your station alone He'll know that you are Know when you see him Nothing can free him Step aside, open wide I wanna live with a cinnamon girl I could be happy The rest of my life With a cinnamon girl A dreamer of pictures I run in the night You see us together Chasing the moonlight My cinnamon girl Ten silver saxes A bass with a bow The drummer relaxes And waits between shows For his cinnamon girl A dreamer of pictures I run in the night You see us together Chasing the moonlight My cinnamon girl Be on my side I'll be on your side There is no reason for you to hide It's so hard for me Staying here all alone When you could be taking me For a ride She could drag me Over the rainbow Send me away Down by the river I shot my baby Down by the river Dead You take my hand I'll take your hand Together we may get away This much madness is Too much sorrow It's impossible to make it today She could drag me Over the rainbow Send me away Down by the river I shot my baby Down by the river Dead Be on my side I'll be on your side There is no reason for you to hide It's so hard for me Staying here all alone When you could be taking me For a ride"
Ohio (CSNY),"Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin' We're finally on our own This summer I hear the drummin' Four dead in Ohio Gotta get down to it Soldiers are gunning us down Should have been done long ago What if you knew her and Found her dead on the ground? How can you run when you know?

Right Between the Eyes,"My head is hanging heavy with the thoughts of him in mind 'Tis sacrilege for us to take advantage of the blind So, tell before you come to me from out of yonder skies A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyes And the pain that we can bring to him I don't think he could beat Please don't ask me how I know I've just been up that street And all the people living there Have been silenced by their own lies A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyes And talking' from experience I know how he would feel Waking up and finding that his one love wasn't real But the age of truth will soon appear, Aquarius arrives A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyes"
A Letter Home Intro,"Hi mom! Hey, itâ€™s great to be able to talk to you Ah, I havenâ€™t been able to talk to you in really a long time and ah, my friend Jack has got this box that I can talk to you from So Iâ€™d like to be able to send you this message and tell you how much I love you and also tell you that I think you should start talking to daddy again. Since youâ€™re both there together thereâ€™s no reason not to talk And also, um, you know how we used to watch the weather all the time on TV, and we used to know what was happening, ah, you know up there in Winnipeg And ah, well I met this guy named Al and heâ€™s, um, heâ€™s the weatherman now for the whole planet If you can imagine that, and ah, heâ€™s uh, sometimeâ€™s not popular because, uh, this is very strange but, you know people turn on the weatherman When the weather is gonna be bad, they actually turn on the weatherman and uh, say bad things about him and put him down So, so uh, things havenâ€™t been that great lately, uh you know, day by day is real good, uh, you know most of the time but every once in a while all hell breaks loose, mom and the whole thing is just like nothing Iâ€™ve ever seen before and it, it seems to be happening everywhere So ah, you know if youâ€™re in there, everywhere all the time All around the whole globe, around earth So you know, even though Alâ€™s forecasts are good he gets in trouble So ah, you know I always know we used to watch the weather forecast together so I thought Iâ€™d tell you about that and ah, I miss you And I know that ah, I-I know that ah, you know Iâ€™d like you to say hello to Ben for me Ah and, tell him that you know that Iâ€™ll be around, ah, Iâ€™ll be there eventually. Ah, not for a while though, I still have a lot of work to do here And ah, and so I love you, and ah I hope everybodyâ€™s feeling good up there and donâ€™t forget to talk to daddy, bye!"
Changes,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air Share in a memory of gray And wander in my words Dream about the pictures that I play Of changes Green leaves of summer turn to red in the fall To brown and to yellow they fade And then they have to die Trapped within the circle time parade Of changes Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind Visions of shadows that shine One day I returned And found that they were victims of the vines Of changes The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark Swings through a hollow of haze A race around the stars A journey through the universe ablaze With changes Moments of magic will glow in the night Fears of the forest are all gone But when the morning breaks They're swept away by golden drops of dawn Of changes Passions will part to a strange melody As fires will sometimes burn cold Like petals in the wind We're puppets to the silver strings of souls Of changes Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else One last cup of wine we will pour And I'll kiss you one more time And leave you on the rolling river shores Of changes"
Crazy,"Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new Worry, why do I let myself worry? Wondering, what in the world did I do? Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you I'm crazy for trying, I'm crazy for crying I'm crazy for loving you I'm crazy for crying, I'm crazy for trying I'm crazy for loving you"
Early Morning Rain,"In the early mornin' rain With a dollar in my hand And an achin' in my heart And my pockets full of sand I'm a long way from home And I miss my loved ones so In the early mornin' rain With no place to go Out on runway number nine Seven-o-seven set to go And I'm stuck here in the ground In the pain that ever grows And the liquor tasted good And the women all were fast Yeah, there she goes my friend She'll be rollin' down at last Hear the mighty engines roar See the silver wing on high She's away and westward bound Far above the clouds she'll fly Where the mornin' rain don't fall Where the sun always shines She'll be flyin' o'er my home In about three hours time This old airport's got me down It's no earthly good to me 'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground Cold and drunk as I can be You can't jump a jet plane Like you can a freight train So I'd best be on my way In the early mornin' rain"
I Wonder If I Care as Much,"I wonder if I care as much As I did before Last night I cried myself to sleep for the one that makes me weep I dried my eyes to greet the day and wondered why I had to pay The tears that I have shed by day give relief and wash away The memory of the night before, I wonder if I'll suffer more I wonder if I care as much As I did before My pride is made to say forgive and take the blame for what you did It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of, I wonder if I'm still in love My heart can't thrive on misery, my life it has no destiny When things get more than I can bear, I ask myself ""Do I still care?"" I wonder if I care as much As I did before"
If You Could Read My Mind,"If you could read my mind love What a tale my thoughts could tell Just like an old time movie 'Bout a ghost from a wishing well In a castle dark or a fortress strong With chains upon my feet You know that ghost is me And I will never be set free As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see If I could read your mind love What a tale your thoughts could tell Just like a paperback novel The kind the drugstores sell When you reach the part where the heartaches come The hero would be me But heroes often fail And you won't read that book again Because the ending's just too hard to take I'd walk away like a movie star Who gets burned in a three-way script Enter number two A movie queen to play the scene Of bringing all the good things out in me But for now love, let's be real I never thought I could feel this way And I've got to say that I just don't get it I don't know where we went wrong But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back If you could read my mind love What a tale my thoughts could tell Just like an old time movie 'Bout a ghost from a wishing well In a castle dark or a fortress strong With chains upon my feet But stories always end And if you read between the lines You'll find that I'm just trying to understand The feelings that you lack I never thought I could feel this way And I've got to say that I just don't get it I don't know where we went wrong But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back"
My Hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town He'd tousle my hair and say ""Son, take a good look around"" ""This is your hometown, this is your hometown This is your hometown, this is your hometown In '65 tension was running high at my high school There was lots of fights 'tween blacks and whites, there was nothing you could do Two cars at a light on a Saturday night, in the back seat there was a gun Words were passed, in a shotgun blast and troubled times had come To my hometown, my hometown My hometown, mo my hometown Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad track Foreman says ""These jobs are going, boys, and they ain't coming back"" ""To your hometown, your hometown Your hometown, your hometown"" Last night me and Kate laid in bed talkin' about getting out Packing up our bags and maybe heading south I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said, ""Son take a good look around This is your hometown"""
Needle of Death,"When sadness fills your heart Sorrow hides the longing to be free When things go wrong with each day You fix your mind to escape your misery Your troubled young life Had made you turn To the needle of death How strange, your happy words Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone How tears have filled the eyes Of friends that you once walked among Your troubled young life Had made you turn To the needle of death One grain of pure white snow Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain In peace your mind withdraws Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain Your troubled young life Has made you turn To the needle of death Your mother stands a-cryin' While to the earth your body's slowly cast Your father stands in silence Caressing every young dream of the past And your troubled young life Had made you turn To the needle of death Through ages, man's desires To free his mind, to releive his very soul Has proved to all who live That death itself is freedom for evermore And your troubled young life Might make you turn To the needle of death And your troubled young life Had make you turn To the needle of death"
On the Road Again,On the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends Now I just can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Goin' places that I've never been Seein' things I may never see again And I just can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway We're the best of friends Insisting that the world keep turning our way And our way Is on the road again I just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is makin' music with my friends I just can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Goin' places I've never been Seein' things I may never see again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway I just can't wait to get on the road again That was good. That was a funky one. (Yeah yeah yeah)
Since I Met You Baby,"Since I met you baby my whole life has changed Since I met you baby my whole life has changed And my friends all tell me that I am not the same I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to Well, I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to 'Cause since I met you baby all I need is you Since I met you baby I'm a happy man Yeah, since I met you baby I'm a happy man I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can"
After the Gold Rush,"Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin' Sayin' something about a queen There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin' And the archer split the tree There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun That was floating on the breeze Look at Mother Nature on the run In the 1970s Look at Mother Nature on the run In the 1970s I was lyin' in a burned out basement With the full moon in my eyes I was hopin' for replacement When the sun burst through the sky There was a band playin' in my head And I felt like getting high I was thinkin' about what a friend had said I was hopin' it was a lie Thinkin' about what a friend had said I was hopin' it was a lie Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin' In the yellow haze of the sun There were children cryin' and colors flyin' All around the chosen ones All in a dream, all in a dream The loadin' had begun Flying Mother Nature's silver seed To a new home in the sun Flying Mother Nature's silver seed To a new home"
Birds,"Lover, there will be another one Who'll hover over you beneath the sun Tomorrow, see the things that never come today When you see me fly away without you Shadow on the things you know Feathers fall around you And show you the way to go It's over, it's over Nestled in your wings, my little one Is special, morning brings another sun Tomorrow, see the things that never come today When you see me fly away without you Shadow on the things you know Feathers fall around you And show you the way to go It's over, it's over, oh"
Cripple Creek Ferry,"Hey, hey, Cripple Creek Ferry Butting through the overhanging trees Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry The waters going down, it's a mighty tight squeeze All alone the captain stands Hasn't heard from his deck hands The gambler tips his hat And walks towards the door It's the second half of the cruise And you know he hates to lose Hey, hey, Cripple Creek Ferry Butting through the overhanging trees Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry The waters going down, it's a mighty tight squeeze"
Don't Let It Bring You Down,Old man lying by the side of the road With the lorries rolling by Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load And the buildings scrape the sky Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn And the morning paper flies Dead man lying by the side of the road With the daylight in his eyes Don't let it bring you down It's only castles burning Find someone who's turning And you will come around Blind man running through the light of the night With an answer in his hand Come on down to the river of sight And you can really understand Red lights flashing through the window in the rain Can you hear the sirens moan? White cane lying in a gutter in the lane If you're walking home alone Don't let it bring you down It's only castles burning Find someone who's turning And you will come around Don't let it bring you down It's only castles burning Just find someone who's turning And you will come around Don't let it bring you down It's only castles burning Just find someone who's turning And you will come around
I Believe in You,"Now that you've found yourself losing your mind Are you here again? Finding that what you once thought was real Is gone and changing Now that you made yourself love me Do you think I can change it in a day? How can I place you above me? Am I lying to you when I say That I believe in you? Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh I believe in you Coming to you at night, I see my questions I feel my doubts Wishing that maybe in a year or two we could laugh And let it all out Now that you made yourself love me Do you think I can change it in a day? How can I place you above me? Am I lying to you when I say That I believe in you? Oh oh, ooh ooh, oh oh I believe in you Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh I believe in you"
"Oh, Lonesome Me","Everybody's going out and having fun I'm a fool for staying home and having none I can't get over how she set me free Oh, lonesome me There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues Forget about the past, find someone new I've thought of everything from A to Z Oh, lonesome me I'll bet she's not like me She's out and fancy free Flirting with the boys with all her charms But I still love her so And brother, don't you know I'd welcome her right back here in my arms There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues Forget about my past, find someone new I can't get over how she set me free Oh, lonesome me"
Southern Man,"Southern man better keep your head Don't forget what your good book said Southern change gonna come at last Now your crosses are burning fast Southern man I saw cotton and I saw black Tall white mansions and little shacks Southern man, when will you pay them back?

Tell Me Why,"Sailin' heart ships through broken harbors Out on the waves in the night Still the searcher must ride the dark horse Racing alone in his fright Tell me why Tell me why Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself When you're old enough to repay But young enough to sell? Tell me lies later, come and see me I'll be around for a while I am lonely but you can free me All in the way that you smile Tell me why Tell me why Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself When you're old enough to repay But young enough to sell?

After the Storm,After the clouds disappear After the rainbow has gone I'm left with a song in my ear The melody is lingering on How come I have to explain Music is worth all the pain After the rain washes down After all the fog burns away Will I see the sun coming 'round? Closer and closer each day How come I have to explain People are worth all the pain I just want to see the love in your eyes After the storm has passed you and gone When you're dreaming of how it can be It doesn't work to pretend Let me tell you what happened to me Just to get to the end I needed a friend After the rainbow had gone It's so sad losing a friend But the memories are lingering on How come I have to explain Children are worth all the pain I just want to see the love in your eyes After the storm has passed you and gone I just want to see the love in your eyes After the storm has passed you and gone
Bad Boyz,Have you been watchin' the bad boyz Hangin' around the schoolyard? Has anyone tried to figure out How it is they got so bitter and hard Does anyone have the faintest idea How we gonna explain Life to them so far They can't hang out on the street They can't hang out with the boyz Unless they're packin' heat And ready to make some noise like the bad boyz Have you been watchin' the hatred Growing every day between the children? Have you been watchin' the races On each other's cases and all suspicious? Somebody's always in your face It's almost like bein' raped You're so defenseless You can't hang out on the street You can't hang out with the boyz Unless you're packin' heat Ready to make some noise like the bad boyz Hope you get there in time Lose 'em all down the line Way down yonder on the plantation Today it's called the 'hood and everyone's restless They feel deserted and abandoned They do the best they can but life is ruthless If ya never did care about your neighbor Cuz their frightening behavior Get through to ya Don't ya see they can't hang out on the street They can't hang out with the boyz Unless they're packin' heat Ready to make some noise they're the bad boyz They can't hang out on the street They can't hang out with the boyz Unless they're packin' heat Ready to make some noise they're the bad boyz They're the bad boyz
Camera,"I rode my bike to town today Wobbling down the path I knew the kids would see me I love it when they laugh And I wish I were a camera And I could slice time like a knife Seeing stories in the faces And crystallizing life Wish I were a camera I wish it all the time It gives my eyes a reason It gives my life a rhyme I'd be a lens that could see souls A shutter that never shuts I'd have film that lasts forever I would live in huts In the jungles of South America Like my father before the war I'd find out where we came from And what this life is for And I wish I were a camera I wish it all the time It gives my eyes a reason It gives my life a rhyme I wish I were a camera I wish it all the time It gives my eyes a reason It gives my life a rhyme And I would climb right off this planet On the clearest night of all And photograph the future When it finally comes to call I would save up all these images These instants in a box And when I am old and lonely They could cover up the clocks And I wish I were a camera I wish it all the time It gives my eyes a reason It gives my life a rhyme I wish that I could shoot at night And leave without a trace And catch my lover's sleeping smile By the starlight on her face But I think mostly that I'd see children 'Cause they haven't learned to hide And they watch me on my bicycle And laugh with me as I ride While I ride, while I ride While I ride, while I ride ..."
Find a Dream,"Life is uncertain, life is unknown Life is a shot in the dark Life is a curtain, always unfolding Life is an ember and a spark Don't be a fool Stay around for a long time Try and find a dream Time avoids no one, time is unkind Time is a cut to the bone Time to take care of, time to unwind Time is a gift not a loan Don't be a fool Stay around for a long time Try and find a dream People are endless, people are strangers People are taken to be friends People are nervous, always in danger People are bound to make amends Don't be a fool Stay around for a long time Try and find a dream"
In My Life,There are places I remember All my life though some have changed Some forever not for better Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living In my life I've loved them all But of all these friends and lovers There is no one compares with you And these memories lose their meaning When I think of love as something new And I know I'll never ever lose affection For people and things that went before And I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I've loved you more In my life I've loved you more
It Won't Go Away,"Don't you get tired Of listening to the cover up Sounds like a broken old record When the needle gets stuck You got your media honeys Using their TV voice Tellin' you what you done decided As if you had any choice And didn't they cry And worry 'bout people of color And didn't they mostly turn away Keep us afraid of each other And you know it's a lie It ain't about people of color The American Dream betrayed And all of us feel the same rage And it won't go away Isn't it strange Ain't it a mystery How did he get it in his head Somehow he could speak for me Hey, if what he's been a' saying Is actually what he believes Then one of us surely is a fool And you know that he thinks that it's me And didn't they cry And worry 'bout people of color And didn't they mostly turn away Keep us afraid of each other And you know it's a lie It ain't about people of color The American Dream betrayed And all of us feel the same rage And it won't go away Somebody wants us divided Someone of evil intent Trying to confuse and control The minds of the innocent And isn't it time Good people have got to speak up And you'll know exactly what to say When you've finally had enough Don't you go try And blame it on people of color And don't you dare turn away Keep us afraid of each other Cause you know it's a lie It ain't about people of color The American Dream betrayed And all of us feel the same rage And it won't go away Won't go away Won't go away Won't go away"
Only Waiting for You,"I cannot remember feeling quite so self assured It must have been back in my teens I was such a basket case when I was young It's obviously something that I dreamed I have always been a most reclusive kind of guy When love's around I usually run and hide Don't you go believin' I was ever that confused I was really only waiting for you Really only waiting for you And what do you suppose that we can do Anything whatever that you want to last forever Really only waiting for you And I cannot escape the over-whelming feeling Destiny has taken us in hand And nothing that we do is gonna change The way this love affair is never gonna end And I know it's hard getting used to the idea That your lover wants to be your best friend With a showing of affection and a measure of romance This is really only waiting for you Really only waiting for you And what do you suppose that we can do Anything whatever that you want to last forever Really only waiting for you Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you I've been living by myself I do not want for someone else At least that's what I like to say And it was working till the other day I met you And I fell in love from twenty yards away I've got one last truly great love left in my life And my heart is tellin' me it might be you So forget your disappointments I'll forget about my past I was really only waiting for you Really only waiting for you And what do you suppose that we can do Anything whatever that you want to last forever Really only waiting for you Really only waiting for you And what do you suppose that we can do Anything whatever that you want to last forever"
Panama,"Have you seen Panama Where I first fell in love It will forever be an emerald necklace Set between the seas Beside a crystal stream In the mountains of Chiriqui I saw a girl astride a horse she waved at me I was fifteen I was not a child I was not yet a man I was trying very hard to understand Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama? Went riding off alone Much further than I should have gone I wandered deep into the dark Now which way gets me home Then suddenly there she was All covered with leaves and dust I couldn't believe it but she followed me Now both of us were lost I was not a child I was not yet a man I was trying very hard to understand Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama? The clouds began to rumble We found a dry piece of jungle I don't remember if It rained But I remember making love So clearly I recall The magic of Panama And surely never will it let me go Yo Soy Panameno I was not a child I was not yet a man I was trying very hard to understand Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama? La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la ..."

Didn't we challenge these niggas in order to bring disorder to the typical ways of things? And it ended up being a slaughter 'Cause no one responded, besides some sly comments And in the calmness of this contest we was like: ""fuck it"" Why don't I challenge my brothers? I'd rather damage my brothers than challenge these average advocates or letting savages hush 'em And every time they chucked a shot right where we were standing we muffed them The thrill of them is like fucking bitches with rubbers, it's okay I'm busting shots and I still feel protected And then we did this just to further the disrespect We put our foots down and kept it there to murder these niggas' necks I would say pause, but this' basically a facefuck Just hear me out: They on they knees when they face us, right? They tearing up, not even seeds will replace us They swallow pride and in defeat they can taste us And then we speak because it's easy to say stuff So spit it out, my last one, I guess I'm in and out I said what I said: no more cyphers, fuck it, I'm switching routes Got bigger issues than these niggas I can live without Right?

Feel like a scarecrow on a sanity search I want some more my nigga hand me a her She want to drip like 'does this canopy work?' I'm trying to bubble big like manatee burps Vanity's first, but sit around 'cause I can't stand to be hurt And feel it up till I'm feeling up, but got no hands in these shirts Fighting the clock like do these hands even work? Think that its time that we face the function We' tired of faking funk Some sensitive thugs need hugs, this one's trying to embrace the culture Trying to face my demons, my sinus can't take this sulfur Still trying to make the team although I didn't make the cut I'm bruising 'em just enough, by the half I'll be chugging jumpers I'm cut from a different cloth, wish I had a tailor: that's Shumpert This cat that had claimed we jumped him came back, had to duck the thumber I used to laugh, but I done lost three homies and it's just this summer I already miss sitting on the steps with Prince, hear my homie Tori telling him that Porter better win I envision them with feather wings, golden crowns, and leathermans Surrounded by better things, like freaky girls with wedding rings You feel me? I know they watch me as I work the handle I know they asking why I treat chances like birthday candles I know they stressed when I miss the message and vexed when I miss my blessings Some don't judge ignorance, some go to work with gavels And my dog, Sarge, thinks I'm talented, but disregard the challenges And ain't offer the job because he thought I couldn't manage it Well a part of me agrees, but see, my daughters gotta eat I know my cup is running full, I see each part of it that leaks Fuck a minute, take a while Fuck some inches, take a mile Because 12 ain't enough, you see, that's partially defeat Just a foot inside the door to beg your pardon, let me speak Know my mental's kind of strong when other parts of me is weak When it's hard up in these streets, I put my heart up in these beats For some garbage making artist to get farther 'cause he screams Just imaging a young fraction going hard until he bleeds Just to have somebody average come and hog the place (he seeks) When almost every chick you dated only came with hope you make it Close your face, she in the matrix, getting naked for some other nigga Or back when immigration at my place to come and take the closest thing to motivation in my face I miss my brother, nigga! Gotta get this thing out of me Transmutative like Alchemy A golden tongue that translated this child speak, silver lines Copper coins that paid for thoughts that's transported this olive tree So peace, peace, peace, broken down Transmission ain't revving, I run - DMC That's always flexing the puns, pun intended Triple entendres extended, just to have a sentence 'Cause I hide behind these bars When dry responses needed quenching Take a shot, I dare you take a shot at being transparent I ain't have a mom or dad specifically like trans parents Just a chemical imbalance, that's teedered on the edge of madness or self-inflicted damage - so I try both And I ain't never try hope, just struggled with the tight rope, around a ceiling fan ... Feeling ill, trying to kill myself, trying to hang myself in my ceiling fan, see My dad raised me to be the only boy to protect everybody While being a direct reason why I couldn't protect anybody The self-inflicted conflicted feelings of feeling like you gotta kill your dad to protect your mother while not protecting her feelings really got to me Guilt ridden from considering committing this atrocity While feeling like my sis and mom ain't have to hurt if not for me Being so weak and worthless and my dad's deceased in hearses An I just concede to hurting, and now I gotta be this person To provide for them, to protect and die for them And I'm six and never learned how to be Chris, or even try for them I'm fearful of the size of 'em, the demons that reside in 'em And traumatizing clips that clipped my wings before I flied for them And they make me feel wrong just to talk about it When it took me this long just to talk about it 'Cause my dad was a legend, that doesn't mean I'm not human 'Cause it's masked as a lesson, that doesn't mean it's abusive 'Cause I'm all in your mentions, that doesn't mean it's intrusive And I grew up a fucking screw up with vision skewed the way that they viewed us Feeling blue so got booed up with bitches that were only with me in case of the chance that I blew up And I accepted it; as a neglected kid I never did love myself They told me to be flexible, that's how they teach you to fuck yourself And I know I'm incredible, but I never learn how to trust myself And I know I hold back a lot, but I never learned how to hug myself And I know I'm not defined by my past, or my inability to act because of fears of the future And I know when I'm looking back at this moment I should've known I was chosen, the path was frozen, that's what made me much cooler In my medulla... This ain't about you right now. It's about my man right here. Oswin talk to 'em Yeah, look Any nigga with skin dark as sin considered an orphan Miss Hannigans had me consider deep sleep in a coffin Hair course as a college credit My lips like Kylie with the collagen in it And self-hatred has been exhibited - isn't it Magnificent how we focus more on the frivolous? You' cute for being collagenous, ridiculous I don't get intimate with none of those black boys, both sentences have been infamous Subjected to these thoughts without a syllabus Associated acts with black skin is villainous, I lack that privilege Been taught to hate my shade before the day that I got into it All hail the Hemmingsworths and chastise the Chadwick's Bosemen's We praise this white God, forgetting we're royal - moments when Thunder comes, cover my chest while I'm running from The spears they threw at this young T'challa threw logic he's young But he gotta be dumb, misdiagnosed, profound breath from out of my lung, Ritalin prescribed till my body was numb They silence the tongue of this melinated Keanu Reeves Unaware that Oswin had been a 1-of-1 Blinded by my dark side, innocent my heart cry Never saw those heart eyes, no, my crushes fell alongside Lighter pigment heart throbs, who never got their heart, right (Chris: Really?) Nigga, duh! I hated every pretty, boujie girl passing notes to everyone, but me My ex got paid to date me, she prolly got paid to fuck me I prolly never got over that, I started fucking her cousin Looking outside of myself to become someone that I wasn't, cautious I went in raw, no intention on being awkward She took that life inside of me the day she got that abortion And the part that haunted me was that the lost seed didn't belong to me It was the offspring of a breed lighter than Neosporin Momma said that devil's working Nah, I didn't heed the warning, being honest, speaking on this Helped me see what's wrong, so now I can see the morning And I hated you, hated ya smiles, hated ya grins Put my hatred on you because that place that I lived Places made vacant since color wars as innocent kids Calisthenics, I pushed myself down trying to uplift more calisthenics I pulled it together and get my chin up Got older and brighter, realised that my darkness' a gift My culture, the landing strip for every vulture that lit We've been that bic, the little light that shines despite where it is I learned that melanin on the scale outweighs gold - so if I say so I feel the wealth inside of the skin that I'm in This ain't no black and white thing It's a me and you despite the feud within ourselves we identify it and get it right thing, yeah MAKE SOME NOIISEEEEEEE!"

He Played Real Good for Free,"I slept last night in a good hotel I went shopping today for jewels The wind rushed around the dirty town And the children let out from their schools I was standing on a noisy corner I was waiting for the walking green Across the street he stood And he played real good He was playin' real good for free Me I play for fortunes And those velvet curtain calls I got a black limousine and about thirty-seven criminal Escorting me to this halls And I'll play if you have some money Or if you're a friend to me But that one-man band by the quick lunch stand He was just playin' real good for free Nobody, I say nobody, nobody stopped to hear him Though he played so sweet and high They knew they had never seen him on their TV screen So they passed his music by Me I meant to go over ask for a song Maybe put on a harmony I heard his refrain as the signals changed He was still playin' real good for free"

Anticipatory Crowd,"What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning? Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends. Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary? Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse. Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience? Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism. Were their views on some points divergent? Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand. Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative? The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees. Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past? In 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west. What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination? He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations. As in what ways? From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination? At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. Was it there? It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding. Why was he doubly irritated? Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget. What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple? To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock. Bloom's decision? A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall. Did he fall? By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV. Did he rise uninjured by concussion? Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle. What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive? Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP. Did the man reappear elsewhere? Alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle. Did Stephen obey his sign? Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house. What did Bloom do? He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think? Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra. What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall? Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction. What did Bloom see on the range? On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle. What did Bloom do at the range? He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow. Did it flow? Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound. What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire? Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon. Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap? To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller. What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer? That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language. What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot? The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius. What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress? Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed. Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest? Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation. What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire? The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50Â° to 212Â° Fahrenheit. What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature? A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously. For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled? To shave himself. What advantages attended shaving by night? A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done. Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand. What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence? The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery. What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom? On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences. What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser? Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886. What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow? Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge. Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him? In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction. What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations? The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation. His mood? He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied. What satisfied him? To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles. How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed. What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest? Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly). Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality? His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa. Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun? The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition. Who drank more quickly? Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three. What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act? Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life. Had he found their solution? In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points. What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper? An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you'll find room. If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L. Bloom. Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him? Name, age, race, creed. What anagrams had he made on his name in youth? Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob. Bollo edoom Old Ollebo, M. P. What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888? Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine. Let them hymn it nine times nine. Dearer far than song or wine, You are mine. The world is mine. What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl? Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton. What relation existed between their ages? 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C. What events might nullify these calculations? The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father? Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined. Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them? Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road. Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her? He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa. Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity? Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe. What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased? The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers. Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable? The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant re"

ristination of juvenile agility. Had any special agility been his in earlier youth? Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles. Did either openly allude to their racial difference? Neither. What, the spiral corkscrew

Triad,"You want to know how it will be Me and her or you and me You both stand there with your long hair flowin' Your eyes alive, your minds are still growin', sayin' to me ""What can we do now that we both love you?"" I love you, too I don't really see Why can't we go on as three? You are afraid, embarrassed, too No one has ever, in your life said such an thing to you Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulder A face like ice, just a little bit colder, sayin' ""You cannot do that, it breaks all the rules You learned in school"" But I don't really see Why can't we go on as three? We love each other, it's plain to see It's just one answer that comes right away to a man for me Sister lovers, you heard about what are brothers Maybe in time a whole lot of others, so you see What we can do is to try something new If you're crazy too I don't really see Why can't we go on as three?"
Democratic Liberals,"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies. In fact, I think we'd be fooling ourselves if we had an audience this large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present. This afternoon we want to talk about the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet explains itself. But before we get into it, since this is the year of the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify some things that refer to me personally, concerning my own personal position. I'm still a Muslim. That is, my religion is still Islam. My religion is still Islam. I still credit Mr. Muhammad for what I know and what I am. He's the one who opened my eyes. At present I am the minister of the newly founded Muslim Mosque Incorporated, which has its offices in the Theresa Hotel right in the heart of Harlem, that's the black belt in New York City. And when we realize that Adam Clayton Powell, is a Christian minister, he has Abyssinian Baptist Church, but at the same time he's more famous for his political struggling. And Dr. King is a Christian minister from Atlanta Georgia, or in Atlanta Georgia, but he's become more famous for being involved in the civil rights struggle. There's another in New York, Rev. Galamison, I don't know if you've heard of him out here, he's a Christian minister from Brooklyn, but has become famous for his fight against the segregated school system in Brooklyn. Rev. Cleage, right here, is a Christian minister, here in Detroit, he's head of the Freedom Now Party. All of these are Christian ministers â€¦all of these are Christian ministers but they don't come to us as Christian ministers, they come to us as fighters in some other category. I am a Muslim minister. The same as they are Christian ministers, I'm a Muslim minister. And I don't believe in fighting today on any one front, but on all fronts. In fact, I'm a Black Nationalist freedom fighter. Islam is my religion but I believe my religion is my personal business. It governs my personal life, my personal morals. And my religious philosophy is personal between me and the God in whom I believe, just as the religious philosophy of these others is between them and the God in whom they believe. And this is best this way. Were we to come out here discussing religion, we'd have too many differences from the out start and we could never get together. So today, though Islam is my religious philosophy, my political, economic and social philosophy is black nationalism. You and I â€“ As I say, if we bring up religion, we'll have differences, we'll have arguments, and we'll never be able to get together. But if we keep our religion at home, keep our religion in the closet, keep our religion between ourselves and our God, but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us. The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community. The time when white people can come in our community and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long gone. By the same token, the time when that same white man, knowing that your eyes are too far open, can send another Negro in the community, and get you and me to support him, so that he can use him to lead us astray, those days are long gone too. The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that if you and I are going to live in a black community â€“ and that's where we're going to live, 'cause as soon as you move into one of theirâ€¦.soon as you move out of the black community into their community, it's mixed for a period of time, but they're gone and you're right there all by yourself again. We must, we must understand the politics of our community and we must know what politics is supposed to produce. We must know what part politics play in our lives. And until we become politically mature, we will always be misled, led astray, or deceived or maneuvered into supporting someone politically who doesn't have the good of our community at heart. So the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program, a political program, of reeducation â€“ to open our people's eyes, make us become more politically conscious, politically mature. And then, we will â€“ whenever we are ready to cast our ballot, that ballot will be cast for a man of the community, who has the good of the community at heart. The economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we should own and operate and control the economy of our community. You would never have foundâ€”you can't open up a black store in a white community. White man won't even patronize you. And he's not wrong. He got sense enough to look out for himself. It's you who don't have sense enough to look out for yourself. The white man, the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community. But you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses, under the pretext that you want to integrate. Nah, you're out of your mind. The political â€¦ the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to become involved in a program of reeducation, to educate our people into the importance of knowing that when you spend your dollar out of the community in which you live, the community in which you spend your money becomes richer and richer, the community out of which you take your money becomes poorer and poorer. And because these Negroes, who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, the Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer. And then what happens? The community in which you live becomes a slum. It becomes a ghetto. The conditions become rundown. And then you have the audacity to complain about poor housing in a rundown community, while you're running down yourselves when you take your dollar out. And you and I are in a double trap because not only do we lose by taking our money someplace else and spending it, when we try and spend it in our own community we're trapped because we haven't had sense enough to set up stores and control the businesses of our community. The man who is controlling the stores in our community is a man who doesn't look like we do. He's a man who doesn't even live in the community. So you and I, even when we try and spend our money on the block where we live or the area where we live, we're spending it with a man who, when the sun goes down, takes that basket full of money in another part of the town. So we're trapped, trapped, double-trapped, triple-trapped. Any way we go, we find that we're trapped. Any every kind of solution that someone comes up with is just another trap. But the political and economic philosophy of black nationalismâ€¦the economic philosophy of black nationalism shows our people the importance of setting up these little stores, and developing them and expanding them into larger operations. Woolworth didn't start out big like they are today; they started out with a dime store, and expanded, and expanded, and expanded until today they are all over the country and all over the world and they getting some of everybody's money. Now this is what you and I â€“ General Motors, the same way, it didn't start out like it is. It started out just a little rat-race type operation. And it expanded and it expanded until today it's where it is right now. And you and I have to make a start. And the best place to start is right in the community where we live. So our people not only have to be reeducated to the importance of supporting black business, but the black man himself has to be made aware of the importance of going into business. And once you and I go into business, we own and operate at least the businesses in our community. What we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community. And once you can create some employment in the community where you live, it will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully, boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job. Anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job, you're in bad shape. When you â€” and he is your enemy. You wouldn't be in this country if some enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here. On the other hand, some of you think you came here on the Mayflower. So as you can see, brothers and sisters, today â€“ this afternoon it is not our intention to discuss religion. We're going to forget religion. If we bring up religion we'll be in an argument. And the best way to keep away from arguments and differences, as I said earlier, put your religion at home, in the closet, keep it between you and your God. Because if it hasn't done anything more for you than it has, you need to forget it anyway. Whether you are a Christian or a Muslim or a nationalist, we all have the same problem. They don't hang you because you're a Baptist; they hang you 'cause you're black. They don't attack me because I'm a Muslim. They attack me 'cause I'm black. They attacked all of us for the same reason. All of us catch hell from the same enemy. We're all in the same bag, in the same boat. We suffer political oppression, economic exploitation and social degradation. All of 'em from the same enemy. The government has failed us. You can't deny that. Any time you're living in the 20th century, 1964, and you walking around here singing ""We Shall Overcome,"" the government has failed you. This is part of what's wrong with you, you do too much singing. Today it's time to stop singing and start swinging. You can't sing up on freedom. But you can swing up on some freedom. Cassius Clay can sing. But singing didn't help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Swinging helped him. So this government has failed us. The government itself has failed us. And the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us. And once we see that all of these other sources to which we've turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves. We need a self-help program, a do-it-yourself philosophy, a do-it-right-now philosophy, a it's-already-too-late philosophy. This is what you and I need to get with. And the only time â€“ the only way we're going to solve our problem is with a self-help program. Before we can get a self-help program started, we have to have a self-help philosophy. Black nationalism is a self-help philosophy. What's so good about it â€“ you can stay right in the church where you are and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. You can stay in any kind of civic organization that you belong to and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. You can be an atheist and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. This is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division and argument, 'cause if you're black, you should be thinking black. And if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, I'm sorry for you. Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude it changes your behavior pattern. And then you go on into some action. As long as you got a sit-down philosophy you'll have a sit-down thought pattern. And as long as you think that old sit-down thought, you'll be in some kind of sit-down action. They'll have you sitting in everywhere. It's not so good to refer to what you're going to do as a sit-in. That right there castrates you. Right there it brings you down. What goes with it? What â€“ think of the image of someone sitting. An old woman can sit. An old man can sit. A chump can sit, a coward can sit, anything can sit. Well, you and I been sitting long enough and it's time for us today to start doing some standing and some fighting to back that up. When we look at other parts of this Earth upon which we live, we find that black, brown, red and yellow people in Africa and Asia are getting their independence. They're not getting it by singing, 'We Shall Overcome."" No, they're getting it through nationalism. It is nationalism that brought about the independence of the people in Asia. Every nation in Asia gained its independence through the philosophy of nationalism. Every nation on the African continent that has gotten its independence brought it about through the philosophy of nationalism. And it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years. America is just as much a colonial power as England ever was. America is just as much a colonial power as France ever was. In fact, America is more so a colonial power than they, because she is a hypocritical colonial power behind it. What is 20th â€” what, what do you call second-class citizenship? Why, that's colonization. Second-class citizenship is nothing but 20th slavery. How you gonna to tell me you're a second-class citizen? They don't have second-class citizenship in any other government on this Earth. They just have slaves and people who are free! Well, this country is a hypocrite! They try and make you think they set you free by calling you a second-class citizen. No, you're nothing but a 20th century slave. Just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from Asia and Africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country. And 1964 looks like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet. Why does it look like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet? Because Negroes have listened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long, and they're fed up. They've become disenchanted. They've become disillusioned. They've become dissatisfied. And all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent. Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous. And in 1964, this seems to be the year. Because what can the white man use, now, to fool us? After he put down that March on Washington â€“ and you see all through that now, he tricked you, had you marching down to Washington. Had you marching back and forth between the feet of a dead man named Lincoln and another dead man named George Washington, singing, ""We Shall Overcome."" He made a chump out of you. He made a fool out of you. He made you think you were going somewhere and you end up going nowhere but between Lincoln and Washington. So today our people are disillusioned. They've become disenchanted. They've become dissatisfied. And in their frustrations they want action. And in 1964 you'll see this young black man, this new generation, asking for the ballot or the bullet. That old Uncle Tom action is outdated. The young generation don't want to hear anything about ""the odds are against us."" What do we care about odds? When this country here was first being founded, there were thirteen colonies. The whites were colonized. They were fed up with this taxation without representation. So some of them stood up and said, ""Liberty or death!"" I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington â€“ wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. ""Liberty or death"" is was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English. They didn't care about the odds. Why, they faced the wrath of the entire British Empire. And in those days, they used to say that the British Empire was so vast and so powerful that the sun would never set on it. This is how big it was, yet these thirteen little scrawny states, tired of taxation without representation, tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded, told that big British Empire, ""Liberty or death."" And here you have 22 million Afro-Americans, black people today, catching more hell than Patrick Henry ever saw. And I'm here to tell you in case you don't know it â€“ that you got a new, you got a new generation of black people in this country who don't care anything whatsoever about odds. They don't want to hear you ol' Uncle Tom, handkerchief-heads talking about the odds. No! This is a new generation. If they're going to draft these young black men, and send them over to Korea or to South Vietnam to face 800 million Chineseâ€¦ If you're not afraid of those odds, you shouldn't be afraid of these odds. Why is America â€“ why does this loom to be such an explosive political year? Because this is the year of politics. This is the year when all of the white politicians are going to come into the Negro community. You never see them until election time. You can't find them until election time. They're going to come in with false promises. And as they make these false promises they're going to feed our frustrations, and this will only serve to make matters worse. I'm no politician. I'm not even a student of politics. I'm not a Republican, nor a Democrat, nor an American â€“ and got sense enough to know it. I'm one of the 22 million black victims of the Democrats. One of the 22 million black victims of the Republicans and one of the 22 million black victims of Americanism. And when I speak, I don't speak as a Democrat or a Republican, nor an American. I speak as a victim of America's so-called democracy. You and I have never seen democracy â€“ all we've seen is hypocrisy. When we open our eyes today and look around America, we see America not through the eyes of someone who has enjoyed the fruits of Americanism. We see America through the eyes of someone who has been the victim of Americanism. We don't see any American dream. We've experienced only the American nightmare. We haven't benefited from America's democracy. We've only suffered from America's hypocrisy. And the generation that's coming up now can see it. And are not afraid to say it. If you go to jail, so what? If you're black, you were born in jail. If you black you were born in jail, in the North as well as the South. Stop talking about the South. As long as you south of the Canadian border, you South. Don't call Governor Wallace a Dixie governor, Romney is a Dixie Governor. Twenty-two million black victims of Americanism are waking up and they are gaining a new political consciousness, becoming politically mature. And as they become â€“ develop this political maturity, they're able to see the recent trends in these political elections. They see that the whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again. Which means that any block, any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position. Either way you go, that's who gets it. You're in a position to determine who'll go to the White House and who'll stay in the doghouse. You're the one who has that power. You can keep Johnson in Washington D.C., or you can send him back to his Texas cotton patch. You're the one who sent Kennedy to Washington. You're the one who put the present Democratic administration in Washington, D.C. The whites were evenly divided. It was the fact that you threw 80 percent of your votes behind the Democrats that put the Democrats in the White House. When you see this, you can see that the Negro vote is the key factor. And despite the fact that you are in a position to be the determining factor, what do you get out of it? The Democrats have been in Washington, D.C. only because of the Negro vote. They've been down there four years. And they're â€“ all other legislation they wanted to bring up they've brought it up, and gotten it out of the way, and now they bring up you. And now they bring up you! You put them first and they put you last. Because you're a chump! A political chump. In Washington, D.C., in the House of Representatives there are 257 who are Democrats. Only 177 are Republican. In the Senate there are 67 Democrats. Only 33 are Republicans. The party that you backed controls two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate and still they can't keep their promise to you. 'Cause you're a chump. Any time you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election-time, and you're dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party, you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to your race. What kind of alibi do come up with? They try and pass the buck to the Dixiecrats. Now, back during the days when you were blind, deaf and dumb, ignorant, politically immature, naturally you went along with that. But today, as your eyes come open, and you develop political maturity, you're able to see and think for yourself, and you can see that a Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat â€“ in disguise. You look at the structure of the government that controls this country, is controlled by 16 senatorial committees and 20 congressional committees. Of the 16 senatorial committees that run the government, 10 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists. Of the 20 congressional committees that run the government, 12 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists. And they're going to tell you and me that the South lost the war? You, today, are in the hands of a government of segregationists. Racists, white supremacists, who belong to the Democratic party but disguise themselves as Dixiecrats. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat. Whoever runs the Democrats is also the father of the Dixiecrats. And the father of all of them is sitting in the White House. I say, and I'll say it again, you got a president who's nothing but a southern segregationist from the state of Texas. They'll lynch in Texas as quick as they'll lynch you in Mississippi. Only in Texas they lynch you with a Texas accent, in Mississippi they lynch you with a Mississippi accent. The first thing the cracker does when he comes in power, he takes all the Negro leaders and invites them for coffee. To show that he's all right. And those Uncle Toms can't pass up the coffee. They come away from the coffee table telling you and me that this man is all right . 'Cause he's from the South and since he's from the South he can deal with the South. Look at the logic that they're using. What about Eastland? He's from the South. Why not make him the president? If Johnson is a good man 'cause he's from Texas, and being from Texas will enable him to deal with the South, Eastland can deal with the South better than Johnson! Oh, I say you been misled. You been had. You been took. I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago while the senators were filibustering and I noticed in the back of the Senate a huge map, and on this map it showed the distribution of Negroes in America. And surprisingly, the same senators that were involved in the filibuster were from the states where there were the most Negroes. Why were they filibustering the civil rights legislation? Because the civil rights legislation is supposed to guarantee boarding rights to Negroes from those states. And those senators from those states know that if the Negroes in those states can vote, those senators are down the drain. The representatives of those states go down the drain. And in the Constitution of this country it has a stipulation, wherein, whenever the rights, the voting rights of people in a certain district are violated, then the representative who's from that particular district, according to the Constitution, is supposed to be expelled from the Congress. Now, if this particular aspect of the Constitution was enforced, why, you wouldn't have a cracker in Washington, D.C. But what would happen? When you expel the Dixiecrat, you're expelling the Democrat. When you destroy the power of the Dixiecrat, you are destroying the power of the Democratic Party. So how in the world can the Democratic Party in the South actually side with you, in sincerity, when all of its power is based in the South? These Northern Democrats are in cahoots with the southern Democrats. They're playing a giant con game, a political con game. You know how it goes. One of 'em comes to you and make believe he's for you. And he's in cahoots with the other one that's not for you. Why? Because neither one of 'em is for you. But they got to make you go with one of 'em or the other. So this is a con game, and this is what they've been doing with you and me all of these years. First thing, Johnson got off the plane when he become president, he ask, ""Where's Dickey?"" You know who Dickey is? Dickey is old southern cracker Richard Russell. Lookie here! Yes, Lyndon B. Johnson's best friend is the one who is a head, who's heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation. You tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson's best friend? How can Johnson be his friend and your friend too? No, that man is too tricky. Especially if his friend is still ol' Dickey. Whenever the Negroes keep the Democrats in power they're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. This is true! A vote for a Democrat is nothing but a vote for a Dixiecrat. I know you don't like me saying that. I'm not the kind of person who come here to say what you like. I'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not. Up here in the North you have the same thing. The Democratic Party don't â€“ they don't do it that way. They got a thing they call gerrymandering. They maneuver you out of power. Even though you can vote they fix it so you're voting for nobody. They got you going and coming. In the South they're outright political wolves, in the North they're political foxes. A fox and a wolf are both canine, both belong to the dog family. Now, you take your choice. You going to choose a northern dog or a southern dog? Because either dog you choose, I guarantee you, you'll still be in the doghouse. This is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody. America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, revolutions are bloody, oh yes they are. They have never had a bloodless revolution. Or a non-violent revolution. That don't happen even in Hollywood You don't have a revolution in which you love your enemy. And you don't have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it. Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems. A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. She's the only country in history, in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless revolution. The Russian Revolution was bloody, Chinese Revolution was bloody, French Revolution was bloody, Cuban Revolution was bloody. And there was nothing more bloody than the American Revolution. But today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything. I hope that the white man can see this. 'Cause if you don't see it you're finished. If you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance. We don't care anything about your atomic bomb; it's useless, because other countries have atomic bombs. When two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them. So it means that the white man today is without a weapon. If you want some action you've got to come on down to Earth, and there's more black people on Earth than there are white people. I only got a couple more minutes. The white man can never win another war on the ground. His days of war â€“ victory â€“ his days of battleground victory are over. Can I prove it? Yes. Take all the action that's going on this Earth right now that he's involved in. Tell me where he's winning â€“ nowhere. Why, some rice farmers, some rice farmers! Some rice-eaters ran him out of Korea, yes they ran him out of Korea. Rice-eaters, with nothing but gym shoes and a rifle and a bowl of rice, took him and his tanks and his napalm and all that other action he's supposed to have and ran him across the Yalu. Why? Because the day that he can win on the ground has passed. Up in French Indochina, those little peasants, rice-growers, took on the might of the French army and ran all the Frenchmen, you remember Dien Bien Phu! The same thing happened in Algeria, in Africa. They didn't have anything but a rifle. The French had all these highly mechanized instruments of warfare. But they put some guerilla action on. And a white man can't fight a guerilla warfare. Guerilla action takes heart, take nerve, and he doesn't have that. He's brave when he's got tanks. He's brave when he's got planes. He's brave when he's got bombs. He's brave when he's got a whole lot of company along with him. But you take that little man from Africa and Asia; turn him loose in the woods with a blade. A blade. That's all he needs. All he needs is a blade. And when the sun comes down â€“ goes down and it's dark, it's even-Stephen. So it's the, it's the ballot or the bullet. Today, our people can see that we're faced with a government conspiracy. This government has failed us. The senators who are filibustering concerning your and my rights, that's the government. Don't say it's southern senators, this is the government. This is a government filibuster. It's not a segregationist filibuster, it's a government filibuster. Any kind of activity that takes place on the floor of the Congress or the Senate, that's the government. Any kind of dilly-dallying, that's the government. Any kind of pussy-footing, that's the government. Any kind of act that's designed to delay or deprive you and me, right now, of getting full rights, that's the government that's responsible. And anytime you find the government involved in a conspiracy to violate the citizenship or the civil rights of a people in 1964, then you are wasting your time going to that government expecting redress. Instead you have to take that government to the world court and accuse it of genocide and all of the other crimes that it is guilty of today. So those of us whose political and economic and social philosophy is black nationalism have become involved in the civil rights struggle. We have injected ourselves into the civil rights struggle. And we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights. As long as you fight it on the level of civil rights, you're under Uncle Sam's jurisdiction. You're going to his court expecting him to correct the problem. He created the problem. He's the criminal! You don't take your case to the criminal, you take your criminal to court. When the government of South Africa began to trample upon the human rights of the people of South Africa they were taken to the U.N. When the government of Portugal began to trample upon the rights of our brothers and sisters in Angola, it was taken before the U.N. Why, even the white man took the Hungarian question to the U.N. And just this week, Chief Justice Goldberg was crying over three million Jews in Russia, about their human rights â€“ charging Russia with violating the U.N. Charter because of its mistreatment of the human rights of Jews in Russia. Now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight? Now you tell me why the leaders of this struggle have never taken So our next move is to take the entire civil rights struggle â€“ problem â€“ into the United Nations and let the world see that Uncle Sam is guilty of violating the human rights of 22 million Afro-Americans right down to the year of 1964 and still "

as the audacity or the nerve to stand up and represent himself as the leader of the free world? Not only is he a crook, we going to do the same thing
Deterring Nuclear,"First thing's first. How could the rest of the world disable the US nuclear capacity? It is virtually impossible to eliminate the US nuclear arsenal since it is based on a triad of land, air, and sea delivery systems designed to provide a counterstrike capability. The submarine-launched ballistic missiles in particular are widely accepted as the most survivable element of the US nuclear deterrent as a portion of it is always at sea. The land-based missiles too are difficult to eliminate, as they are in hardened silos in the middle of the country. Any adversary facing the United States would need to either be willing to absorb a nuclear attack or develop a ballistic-missile defense system currently beyond the scope of anything technologically feasible. Well, Iâ€™ve got a pretty good blueprint of one in my bedroom, so letâ€™s assume itâ€™s totally possible. If not, perhaps we need to go to the source: Obama. Could the nuclear football be grabbed from the president? I canâ€™t really answer this one since we have very little information on the technical aspects. OK. Letâ€™s just assume the technical aspects are that he carries it around in his pocket and Iâ€™ve stolen it. So, once the nuclear capabilities are down, what could an invasion of the US look like? The US is the sole country in the world that has the capability to project force across the globe on a large scale. The combined military air- and sea-lift capability of the rest of the world would be insufficient to even get a foothold on the continental United States. The amphibious assault capability of the world's militaries, excluding the United States, is simply too small. That means the adversary would have to seize and use civilian aircraft and ships not designed for nonpermissive environments. These ships would require secure bases in Canada and Mexico, since they lack the capability to deliver forces onto unimproved shores. Thus, any attempted invasion of the US would first look like a rather motley caravan of vulnerable civilian ships and aircraft. If these forces managed to avoid US attacks and build up, they could then launch an attack over land. Iâ€™m sure we could manage it. Where would an invasion begin? Which parts of the American coast are most vulnerable to attack? As I already noted, the amphibious-assault capability of the combined militaries of the world are simply too insignificant to get a beachhead on a coast. If they managed to go undetected, itself an impossible feat in light of modern surveillance capability, they still could not build up a force of any size before being pushed back into the sea. Thus, an invasion would have to come via a land border, with the terrain of the southern border (that with Mexico) being most conducive to military operations. However, the fact that the largest US Army armor base happens to be in Texas naturally would hinder such an attack. Going through the Canadian borderâ€”out West, to avoid the Great Lakes and St Lawrence Seawayâ€”would be easier, although the invasion would then be limited to light infantry and would have trouble concentrating forces. In addition, it would fail to take over population centers or other important strategic points, since it is mostly national parks out there. Well, once we have the national parks, we have the bears and wolves on our side, which will make us unbeatable. I guess the big question here is: Are the world's combined forcesâ€”including those mad North Koreans, because every little helpsâ€”enough to defeat those of the US? Yes, but only if the US is on the offensive or only if defeat does not equate to conquer or destroy, which it generally does not. The world could, for example, certainly contain the US as the US did the Soviet Union. But the question you are really asking, if I am correct, is: Are the world's combined forces enough to conquer the United States? Here the answer is no, for it is much harder to project force. It requires logistical resources that the rest of the world simply does not have. OK. That's disappointing. The primary problem here is geography. Just as the vast Russian steppe swallows armies, so would the oceans that surround the US. No matter the manpower or armament, it must be delivered across the Pacific and Atlantic in order to be brought to bear. This is where US naval and air power would destroy any adversary, far before they sullied the US shore. And this is where you meet the second primary problem, which is technology. There are not enough aircraft carriers and amphibious warfare ships in the combined navies of the world to force an entry past the US Navy. There are not enough attack fighters to gain air superiority against the US Air Force. This is how amazingly out of balance the military might of the world is today. Could we find a work-around? The solution for the invading world armies would be to negate the importance of geography and technology. This means not relying on armies and navies and air forces but instead targeting the US in the space and cyber domains. By defeating US satellites and attacking US networks, one bypasses geography and eliminates technology, both that of the military and within the industrial base that is at the core of that military might. Cool, so we'll just get the hackers onboard. However, one still does not conquer the soil. So we arrive at the same conclusion: as the world military balance stands today, even in the unlikely case that the entire world aligns against them, the United States could not be conquered. It can only be defeated. I suspect you had hoped for a more Red Dawn-type possibility but I canâ€™t offer one without stretching reality beyond the point of reason. We would have to bring in pure science fiction to make it feasible. Oh well, I guess that's pretty emphatic. Thanks for humoring me, Dylan."

Everybody's Talkin',"Everybody's talkin' at me Can't hear a word they're sayin' Only the echoes of my mind People stoppin', starin' I can't see their faces Only the shadows of their eyes Goin' where the sun keeps shinin' Through the pourin' rain Goin' where the weather suits my clothes Bankin' off of the northeast wind Sailin' on a summer breeze Skippin' over the ocean like a stone Everybody's talkin' at me Can't hear a word they're sayin' Only the echoes of my mind People stoppin', starin' I can't see their faces Only the shadows of their eyes And I won't let you leave my love behind No, I won't let you leave my love behind I won't let you leave my love behind Goin' where the sun keeps shinin' Through the pourin' rain Goin' where the weather suits my clothes Bankin' off of the northeast wind Sailin' on a summer breeze Skippin' over the ocean like a stone"
Guinnevere,"Guinnevere had green eyes Like yours, m'lady, like yours She'd walk down through the garden In the morning after it rained Peacocks wandered aimlessly Underneath an orange tree Why can't she see me? Guinnevere drew pentagrams Like yours, m'lady, like yours Late at night when she thought That no one was watching at all On the wall She shall be free As she turns her gaze Down the slope to the harbor where I lay Anchored for a day Guinnevere had golden hair Like yours, m'lady, like yours Streaming out when we'd ride Through the warm wind down by the bay Yesterday Seagulls circle endlessly I sing in silent harmony We shall be free"
Helplessly Hoping,"Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello? They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on hello They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other"
Lady of the Island,"Holding you close undisturbed before a fire The pressure in my chest when you breathe in my ear We both knew this would happen when you first appeared My lady of the island The brownness of your body in the fire glow Except the places where the sun refused to go Our bodies were a perfect fit, in afterglow we lay My lady of the island Letting myself wander through the world inside your eyes You know I'd like to stay here until every tear runs dry My lady of the island Wrapped around each other in the peeping sun Beams of sunshine light the stage, the red light's on I never want to finish what I've just begun with you My lady of the island"

Marrakesh Express,"Whoopa, hey mesa, hooba, huffa Hey meshy goosh goosh Looking at the world through the sunset in your eyes Traveling the train through clear Moroccan skies Ducks and pigs and chickens call Animal carpet wall-to-wall American ladies five-foot tall in blue Sweeping cobwebs from the edges of my mind Had to get away to see what we could find Hope the days that lie ahead Bring us back to where they've led Listen not to what's been said to you Would you know we're riding On the Marrakesh Express?

Pre-Road Downs,"I have kissed you so I'll miss you On the road I'll be wantin' you But I have you 'cause I love you And you have me 'cause you love me too, yeah Felt forsaken, you'll awaken To the joys of livin' hand in glove And then I will lend you my will And your days will be filled with love Don't run, the time approaches Hotels and midnight coaches Be sure to hide the roaches Felt rejected as expected You rejected all the thoughts of words So I'll pray with you to stay with Me forever and we'll make it work, whoa-oh-oh!

Dangerous Night,"Now some small parts seem right scattered here and there One smiling face in a crowd thatâ€™s angry and scared Canâ€™t seem to see where it doesnâ€™t get worse Itâ€™s like one good thought getting lost in an angry verse I try to write Buddha and it comes out guns I vote for peace and the blood still runs I want to believe I can pass happy to my child But the truth gets lost and the system runs wild Send me someone who has doubts about it Who has conquered their own fear and lived to tell about it Someone who wonâ€™t give up in the frozen rain Whoâ€™ll walk right next to me through the orchards and the grain I wake up from a dream of a baby and a blast Scenes from the television in the blue light it cast Seek peace in your own heart sounds true, sounds right Iâ€™m a troubled soul searching for peace in the night Trying to figure out how it all fits together Humans and sun and oceans and weather And even if I dream alone on such a dangerous night Tryinâ€™ to make all these pieces fit right Even if I dream alone on such a dangerous night Somehow I know Iâ€™m going to dream again tonight"
Find a Heart,"Find a heart that you can speak to In the language of your own soul In the stillness of the water Find the peace to make you whole A passage to illumination Pulling light from the black of coal Make it work like touching skin Make it open so you can reach in Make it breathe, make it sweat Go as deep as you can get In a whisper, in a shout Say it how you want it said to you In a voice so free of doubt All your victories ringing true Breath rising to the surface Ascending slowly into the blue Make it work like touching skin In the eyes of a lover In the words of a friend All the goodness that lies within Is lying just around the bend And when you find this heart of yours Keep it close enough to hear itâ€™s cries In the frame of open an open door See the truth and strike the lies Miles of stone to reach the core A million answers in loveâ€™s disguise"
Holding On to Nothing,"After holding on to nothing for quite awhile I glanced to see what waited there A shadow leaning easy by a window A scent of something recent in the air Nothing runs faster than time at night But time slows down every day All of those hours with nothing to do Holding nothing again today And sunny days can fool you They can look wet with rain And even words from a friend can bring back The pain Memories come back on their own And birds fly south in the sky Pictures are drawn, pencil sketches at dawn Wishes that I too could fly And sunny days can fool you They can look wet with rain Even words from a friend can bring back The pain All the pictures I see are smiling at me But today I'm somebody new Not really knowing, just coming and going A stranger just passing through"
If She Called,"She grinds her hips Maybe arches her back Thereâ€™s nobody there to see when she is doing that The guyâ€™s not there He just doesnâ€™t exist Sheâ€™s looking at empty space when she is doing this She might walk home Sheâ€™s kind of tired Or spend some of the money on a cab sheâ€™s hired Below a bus groans by And splashes a man Who swears out a drunkardâ€™s curse on the whole damned world She smiles at that And then starts to cry She scrubs at a spot on her leg and then lets it dry Then sheâ€™s sitting on the floor With her head hung down Listening to another language on tv Unaware, hair unbound Wondering where her mother and father might be If she called, if she called She dreams, she dreams Donâ€™t we all dream A place, a way A recurring theme She remembers a time When love was alive Somehow it getâ€™s lost in the sound of the cityâ€™s morning drive Lost in the sound of the cityâ€™s roaring, morning drive"
Morning Falling,"His open eyes At first light We see An echo of his mothers smile At her breast His sister pressed Outside The sun begins to warm the ancient tile They came that day, hollow men Agents of a god they could not know A mile above, distant eyes Miss desperate pleas that pictures could not show The morning falling A shackle snaps Beneath cold wings Below The shepherd is pulled toward home The shadow falls A falcon calls BELOW His world becomes a mountain of stone His eyes can see But His mind canâ€™t hold What He has seen The absence of the lives they used to live A world away The trigger is pulled And here there is no reason to forgive"
Radio,"Just like in the movies a message Comes through all the static and hiss Pulling just enough words from the storm filled sky To know that someone somewhere needs this The radioman runs to the wheelhouse Got that message held tight in his fist An S.O.S off of the wireless Saying someone somewhere needs this For you to look out, look down Reach your hand into the water For you to look out, look down And pull someone out of the sea You are the captain, this is the ship You will have to decide what gets done Think about it when youâ€™re on watch tonight â€˜Cause someday this message will come And your hands are slippery The wind is strong The boat is rocking The world is storm Your hands are slippery You feel like turning away to run free Your hands are so slippery But you can pull someone out of the sea (x2)"
Set That Baggage Down,"That trunk is filled with dusty air Ghosts that lived and still donâ€™t care Resist the urge to turn around And set it down Set that baggage down brother Set that baggage down Throw it in the river Let that baggage drown Every girl that left you Every friend that ran Everything that broke you Bury it in the sand Leave it at the station Leave it in the street Toss it in the gutter Set it down by your feet Walk on, walk on Walk on down the road Walk on, walk on No need to carry that load No more, (x6) When you lost your momma When you lost your job When you were feeling hungry No one left to rob Rise up, rise up yeah Rise up, rise up and Set that baggage down brother Set that baggage down, down, down"
Slice of Time,"A slice of time Curling, peeling Back from the edge of the knife Light fluttering As if between two trains Motor-drive frames of life Long blends of days Stream into nights Consciousness barely coping The land going by seems level But really the tracks are Increasingly sloping Images, images, images, images Arranged against a blank wall Images, images, images, images Telling the truth to us all Pluck out a day A week or an hour Hold it up, hold it up to the light Freeze the frame Really look at the faces With all of your sight See the eyes Looking at you Immerse yourself into that minute My teacher said time is elastic I wonder just what Iâ€™ll find in it A slice of time Curling, peeling Back from the edge of the knife"
The Clearing,"Fear doesnâ€™t live inside the blind Let go And step into the clearing mind and soul This kind of love donâ€™t need a home This kind a heart beats all alone This kind of world, gonna let it go Lay down the things that came before Firelight creates families Believe Shadows become giants in the trees The sky is dark enough to swallow you A storm Violence the least of all itâ€™s forms"
Time I Have,"People do so many things that make me mad but Angry isnâ€™t how I want to spend what time I have Cognitive dissonance they call it I wonder just how small it Could be made to be In me There so much disturbing short sighted shit We must be able to do better than just live with it Iâ€™m looking to find some peace within me to embrace To encourage that smile to find my face Sometimes Iâ€™m Winning Life in the city is so densely packed Fear of each other is an accepted fact Fear soaks into concrete just like grease Fear is the antithesis of peace â€œI have a dream,â€ a great man said Another man came and shot him in the head Yet the dream floats out there visible Still alive, still alive Those who rule the middle kingdom hate The old man in the robes They put up road blocks everywhere he goes He says, â€œhave no anger in your heart for them They know not what they doâ€ Does that sound familiar To you, to you (x2)"
Anything at All,"Anything you want to know just ask me I'm the world's most opinionated man I'll give you an answer if I can (Answer) Catch one passing through (Passing through) That feels right for you Anything you want to know just ask me It's worth every cent it costs And you know it's free for you Special deal Ah, ah, oh, oh De, da ... Anything you want to know it should be perfectly clear You see just beneath the surface of the mud There's more mud here Surprise Is there anything you want to know On any subject at all? I've go time for one more question here Before I fall, fall Is there anything at all"
Carried Away,You came from out of the skies Your skin and your eyes The colours of bronze The moon in your ear Twinkled and shone Soon you'll be gone Sailing out on the blue Your old man and you Drifting along Leaving me here Thinking it through Soon you'll be gone Moving through my changes as fast as I can Trying to bring a balance to me and the man Part of me is screaming to say I want to be carried away Moving through my changes as fast as I can Trying to bring a balance to me and the man Part of me is screaming to say I want to be carried away From out of the skies Your skin and your eyes The colours of bronze The star in your ear Twinkled and shone Soon you'll be gone
Cathedral,"6 o'clock in the morning, I feel pretty good So I dropped into the luxury of the Lords Fighting dragons and crossing swords With the people against the hordes Who came to conquer 7 o'clock in the morning Here it comes, I taste the warning And I'm so amazed I'm here today Seeing things so clear this way In the car and on my way To Stonehenge I'm flying in Winchester Cathedral Sunlight pouring through the break of day Stumbled through the door And into the chamber There's a lady setting flowers On a table covered lace And a cleaner in the distance Finds a cobweb on a face And a feeling deep inside of me Tells me this can't be the place I'm flying in Winchester Cathedral All religion has to have its day Expressions on the face of the Saviour Made me say, ""I can't stay"" Open up the gates of the church And let me out of here Too many people have lied in the name of Christ For anyone to heed the call So many people have died in the name of Christ That I can't believe it all And now I'm standing on the grave Of a soldier that died in 1799 And the day he died, it was a birthday And I noticed it was mine And my head didn't know just who I was And I went spinning back in time And I am high upon the altar High upon the altar, high I'm flying in Winchester cathedral It's hard enough to drink the wine The air inside just hangs in delusion But given time, I'll be fine Open up the gates of the church And let me out of here Too many people have lied in the name of Christ For anyone to heed the call Too many people have died in the name of Christ That I can't believe it all And now I'm standing on the grave Of a soldier that died in 1799 And the day he died, it was a birthday And I noticed it was mine And my head didn't know just who I was And I went spinning back in time And I am high upon the altar High upon the altar, high"
Cold Rain,"Cold rain down on my face Buses hurry on Work's out here comes the race People heading home Wait a second, don't I know you? Haven't I seen you somewhere before? You seem to be like someone I knew Yes, he lived here but he left When he thought that there was more Than cold rain and nowhere to go Many people share Sad dreams and hopes that are stained By the sulphur in the air Don't I know you? Haven't I seen you somewhere before? You seem to be like someone I knew He lived here but he left When he thought that there was more Than cold rain out on the streets I am all alone With cold rain down on my face I am heading home"
Dark Star,"Forgive me if my fantasies might seem a little shopworn I'm sure you've heard it all before, I wonder what's the right form Love songs written for you, it's been going down for years But to sing what's in my heart seems more honest than the tears I am curious Don't want to hurry us I'm intrigued with us Ain't this song a bust? I don't care, dark star I met you several years ago The times they were so strange but I had a feeling You looked into my eyes just once An instant flashing by that we were stealing Another time you felt so bad And I wasn't any help at all as I recall We didn't know quite what to do So we left the wanting be Still there for me and you Dark star, I see you in the morning Dark star a-sleeping next to me Dark star, let the memory of the evening Be the first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me, dark star It's easy to be with you Even with the storms that rage beneath your search for peace We must make some time together Take the kids and find a world that's ours to keep Now you've got me dreaming, girl It's been so long I thought that I'd forgotten how My heart is once again my soul We touched, we did, you know we did No more teasing now Dark star, I see you in the morning Dark star a-sleeping next to me Dark star, let the memory of the evening Be the first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me, dark star Dark star, I see you in the morning Dark star a-sleeping next to me Dark star, let the memory of the evening Be the first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me, dark star Let the memory of the evening Be the first thing that you think of When you open up your smile and see me, dark star"
Fair Game,Take a look around you tell me if you see A girl who thinks she's ordinary lookin' she has got the key If you can get close enough to look into her eyes There's something special right behind the bitterness she hides And you're fair game You'll never know what she'll decide You're fair game Just relax enjoy the ride Find a way to reach her make yourself a fool But do it with a little class disregard the rules 'Cause this one knows the bottom line couldn't get a date The ugly duckling striking back and she'll decide her fate And you're fair game You'll never know what she'll decide You're fair game Just relax enjoy the ride The ones you never notice are the ones you have to watch She's pleasant and she's friendly while she's looking at your crotch And try your hand at conversation gossip is a lie And sure enough she'll take you home and make you wanna die And you're fair game You'll never know what she'll decide You're fair game Just relax enjoy the ride
I Give You Give Blind,"Hey, would you dig to be alone? And tell me when will you be back home? And why did you leave me all alone? You blew my mind Fool listen on to yourself You don't know even when you been left Tomorrow maybe you'll see the rest I told you so You gotta believe in something If you don't you will be lost You gotta believe in someone No matter the cost Well, hell if I've been had Then Jesus why's it got to hurt so bad? And when could something come and make me glad To be alive? Look, you got a mind of your own So listen when it says you could be wrong The first time is usually when you hear the song That sets you free Too late you realize that burning bridges behind you Every time you lose insisting on something That perhaps cannot be had You blow it away You gotta believe in something And give it some time You gotta believe in someone Go over the line So love isn't lost so easy And livin' ain't gonna be so cool and breezy Look in my eyes know that I am speaking freely I give you give blind, I give you give blind I give you give blind, oh yeah, I give you give blind Hey would you dig to be alone? And tell me when will you be back home? And why did you leave me all alone? You blew it away"
In My Dreams,"Look at those dancers gliding around Seems as if their feet Don't hardly touch the ground Look at them smiling Like they knew one another And they never would come down Turn around and hold me I'd like to see your face alone I'm hoping there's someone home I'd like to meet you Who do you see? Introduce yourself to whichever of me is nearby Close behind your eyes you're laughing at me And I'm stuck with no instructions that I can see To steer by Stick around it's tricky ground I'd like to see your face alone I'm hoping there's someone home Two or three people fading in and out Like a radio station I'm thinking about But I can't hear Who gets breakfast? Who gets the lunch? Who gets to be the boss of this bunch? Who will steer? Turning Turning To see your face alone I'm hoping there's someone home Dream Do you dream Dreaming Do you? Dream Do you dream Dreaming Do you? In my dreams I can see, I can I can see a love That could be ..."
Just a Song Before I Go,Just a song before I go To whom it may concern Traveling twice the speed of sound It's easy to get burned When the shows were over We had to get back home And when we opened up the door I had to be alone She helped me with my suitcase She stands before my eyes Driving me to the airport And to the friendly skies Going through security I held her for so long She finally looked at me in love And she was gone Just a song before I go A lesson to be learned Traveling twice the speed of sound It's easy to get burned
Run from Tears,"I don't run from tears That's my weakness (a blues man) But I know you still love me Though you don't believe it (that's your choosin') And I never thought that we were a loser Only didn't hear enough of the songs Everything was always going to be smoother All we needed was some time left alone Something special Is in me dying, yeah Are you punishing me For my weakness When you know about me girl I cannot be beaten down too far And I didn't mean to take you for granted Only knew that it felt good at home But you left me so disenchanted I was blind of course until you were gone Yeah, I'm drowning I'm fighting Something special is in me dying, yeah There's an empty place in my bed And my heart is beating against my head, yeah The blood rushing through my veins Becomes a flood of tears once again"
See the Changes,"She has seen me changing It ain't easy rearranging And it gets harder as you get older Farther away as you get closer And I don't know the answer Does it even matter? I'm wonderin' how Ten years singing right out loud I never looked was anybody listening Then I fell out of a cloud I hit the ground and noticed something missing Now I have someone She has seen me changing And it gets harder as you get older And farther away as you get closer And I don't know the answer Does it even matter? I'm wonderin' how Seems like something out of a dream I had years ago yes, I remember screaming Nobody laughing all the good times Getting harder to come by without weeping Now I have someone She has seen me changing And it gets harder as you get older And farther away"
Shadow Captain,"Oh, captain what are we hiding from? You've been hiding from the start Did some lover steal your heart Or did the full moon make you mad? Oh, captain why these speechless seas That never come to land? Oh, I need to understand Could a little light be that bad? I can see your hands are roughened By the wheel and the rope I'd like to look to you for hope I think it's hiding there This boat is blacked out like a city Awaiting bombers in the night Oh, you hold your helm so tight And yet the sky seems so fair Who guides this ship Dreaming through the seas Turning and searching Whichever way you please? Speak to me I need to see your face Shadowy captain In a darkened space If I were to spy a city Floating just above the sea Could we stop and look for me Among those playing on the pier? Or would you turn away knowing It was still a ways away And if I was there today You could not see me all that clear Who guides this ship Dreaming through the seas Turning and searching Whichever way you please? Speak to me I need to see your face Shadowy captain In a darkened space Shadow captain of a charcoal ship Shadow captain of a charcoal ship Trying to give the light the slip"
Almost Gone,"Locked up in a white room, underneath a glaring light Every 5 minutes, they're asking me if I'm alright Locked up in a white room naked as the day I was born 24 bright light, 24 all alone What I did was show some truth to the working man What I did was blow the whistle and the games began Tell the truth and it will set you free That's what they taught me as a child But I can't be silent after all I've seen and done 24 bright light I'm almost gone, almost gone Locked up in a white room, dying to communicate Trying to hang in there underneath a crushing wait Locked up in a white room I'm always facing time 24 bright light, 24 down the line What I did was show some truth to the working man What I did was blow the whistle and the games began But I did my duty to my country first That's what they taught me as a man But I can't be silent after all I've seen and done 24 bright light I'm almost gone, almost gone (Treat me like a human, treat me like a man)"
Bluebird,"Listen to my bluebird laugh she can tell you why Deep within her heart you see she knows only cryin' There she sits aloft at perch strangest color blue Flying is forgotten now thinks only of you Just you Get into all those blues must be a thousand years And each is differently used you just know You sit there mesmerized by the depth of her eyes I can tell you no lies She's got soul, she's got soul, she's got soul, she's got soul Soon she's goin' to fly away sadness is her own Give herself a bath of tears and go home And go home So I listened once again to my bluebird sing Oh yes and children how she made the mountains ring Now when hearts be stilled that voice is spring Oh my precious my soul says to my blue eyed sparrow Fly back home, fly back home, fly back home Do you think she loves you? Do you think at all?"
Carry On/Questions,"One morning I woke up and I knew You were really gone A new day, a new way, I knew I should see it along Go your way, I'll go mine And carry on The sky is clearing and the night Has gone out The sun, he come, the world Is all full of light Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice But to carry on The fortunes of fables are able To sing the song Now witness the quickness with which We get along To sing the blues you've got to live the tunes And carry on Carry on Love is coming Love is coming to us all Where are you going now, my love?

DÃ©jÃ  Vu,"One, two, three, four If I had ever been here before I would probably know just what to do Don't you? If I had ever been here before on another time around the wheel I would probably know just how to deal With all of you And I feel like I've been here before Feel like I've been here before And you know it makes me wonder What's going on under the ground, hmmm Do you know?

Southern Cross,"Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands Sailing a reach before a following sea She was making for the trades on the outside And the downhill run to Papeete Off the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas We got eighty feet of the waterline Nicely making way In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you But on a midnight watch I realized Why twice you ran away (I think about) Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me, larger voices calling What heaven brought you and me Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world) I have been around the world (Looking) Looking for that woman-girl (And I know she knows) Who knows love can endure And you know it will When you see the Southern Cross for the first time You understand now why you came this way 'Cause the truth you might be running from is so small But it's as big as the promise The promise of a coming day So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a-dying And my love is an anchor tied to you Tied with a silver chain I have my ship And all her flags are a-flying She is all that I have left And music is her name (I think about) Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me, larger voices calling What heaven brought you and me Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world) I have been around the world (Looking) Looking for that woman-girl Who knows love can endure And you know it will And you know it will (Yes) So we cheated and we lied and we tested And we never failed to fail It was the easiest thing to do You will survive being bested Somebody fine Will come along, make me forget about loving you In the Southern Cross"

Do You Know How to Use This Weapon?,"Do you know how to use this weapon? - Not really. - That weapon will replace your tongue You will learn to speak through it And your poetry will now be written with blood What is your name? My name is Nobody - Excuse me? - My name is Exaybachay: He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing He Who Talks-- I thought you said your name was Nobody I prefer to be called Nobody"
Nobody's Story,"My blood is mixed My mother was ungumpai picani, my father was habsoluca This mixture was not respected; as a small boy I was often left to myself So I spent many months stalking the Elk people, to prove i would soon become a good hunter One day finally, my Elk relatives took pity on me, and a young Elk gave his life to me With only my knife, I took his life As I was preparing to cut the meat white men came upon me, they were English soldiers I cut one with my knife but they hit me on the head, with a rifle All went black; my spirit seemed to leave me I was then taken east, in a cage I was taken to Toronto, then Philadelphia, and then to New York; and each time I arrived in another city, somehow the white man had moved all thier people there ahead of me Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I could not understand how a whole city of people could be moved so quickly Eventually, I was taken on a ship across the great sea, over to England, and I was paraded before them like a captured animal, an exhibit So I mimicked them, imitating their ways, hoping they might lose interest in this young savage, but their interest only grew I was copying them so they placed me into the white mans school It was there that I discovered, in a book, the words that William Blake had written They were powerful words and they spoke to me So I made careful plans and eventually I escaped Once again I crossed the great ocean I saw many sad things as I made my way back to the lands of my people Once they realized who I was, the stories of my adventures angered them They called me a liar Xebachae-he who talks loud saying nothing Ridiculed by my own people, and I was left to wander the earth alone I am Nobody"

Stupid White Men...,"Stupid white men. William Blake, you go to them What? Why don't we just go around them? No, you go Iâ€™d rather not It's a test I don't know those people. I donâ€™t know if they're friendly or if they'll kill me Nobody will observe All right, I'll go. I'd rather not, but I'll go. What's the fastest way to get down there? Be quiet and go"
"Time for You to Leave, William Blake...","- Well... - I've prepared for you a canoe to sit in this It's time for you to leave now, William Blake..

4 + 20,"Four and twenty years ago I come into this life The son of a woman and a man who lived in strife He was tired of being poor And he wasn't into selling door to door And he worked like the devil to be more A different kind of poverty now upsets me so Night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know Why am I so alone? Where is my woman, can I bring her home? Have I driven her away? Is she gone? Morning comes the sunrise and I'm driven to my bed I see that it is empty and there's devils in my head I embrace the many colored beast I grow weary of the torment, can there be no peace? And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease"
Almost Cut My Hair,"I will now proceed to entangle the entire area Almost cut my hair It happened just the other day It was gettin' kinda long I could-a said, it was in my way But I didn't and I wonder why I feel like letting my freak flag fly Yes I feel like I owe it to someone Must be because I had the flu for Christmas And I'm not feelin' up to par It increases my paranoia Like lookin' at my mirror and seein' a police car But I'm not givin' in an inch to fear 'Cause I promised myself this year I feel like I owe it to someone When I finally get myself together I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather And I find a place inside to laugh Separate the wheat from the chaff I feel like I owe it to someone"
Carry On,"One morning I woke up and I knew You were really gone A new day, a new way And new eyes to see the dawn Go your way, I'll go mine And carry on The sky is clearing and the night Has gone out The sun, he come, the world Is all full of love Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice But to carry on The fortunes of fables are able To sing the song Now witness the quickness with which We get along To sing the blues you've got to live the dues And carry on Carry on Love is coming Love is coming to us all Where are you going now, my love? Where will you be tomorrow? Will you bring me happiness? Will you bring me sorrow? Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams What you do with what you see Lover, can you talk to me? Girl, when I was on my own Chasing you down What was it made you run? Trying your best just to get around The questions of a thousand dreams What you do and what you see Lover, can you talk to me?"

Breakers crash on the beach I count them like lambs in my sleep They come at me steady, they know I'm not ready They pound on my mattress door Have they got a big one in store Losing you, I heard I was losing you That's not the only thing that I got to lose I got to lose the deep sea blues Look at these blues, the deep sea blues I got to lose the deep sea blues Look at these blues, I got the deep sea blues Live with me Live with me Live with me"
Stayin' Power,"Our love, baby, feels so right When you're smiling in the morning light I ain't leaving, no way 'Cause we got staying power, you and I Staying power through thick and thin Staying power, you and I Staying power through thick and thin Gold and diamonds say you're mine But true love opens the gates of time And as we go on our way We got staying power, you and I Staying power through thick and thin Staying power, you and I Staying power through thick and thin Staying power, you and I Staying power through thick and thin Staying power, you and I Staying power through thick and thin"
The Old Homestead,"Up and down the old homestead The naked rider gallops through his head And although the moon isn't full He still feels the pull Out on the floor where the cowboys dance Approaching slowly at a glance Here comes the shadow of his stance The reins are falling from his hands ""Why do you ride that crazy horse?"" Inquires the shadow with little remorse Just then a priest comes down the stairs With a sack of dreams and old nightmares ""Who are you,"" the rider says ""You dress in black but you talk like a fed You spout ideas from books that you've read Don't you care about this guy's head?"" Just then the sound of the hoofbeats was heard And the sky was darkened by a prehistoric bird Who flew between the unfulfilled moon And the naked rider to a telephone booth We'll call the moon and see what's up I've got some change in this little tin cup They say that the shadow is growing dim He needs some light to get back to him Just one call should do it all I'll carve this number on the wall with my beak Flying feathers were all around And the air was filled with a ringing sound Two more birds, the second and the third Came down from the sky to deliver the word ""Where have you been?"" they said to the first ""Get back to the clouds, we're dying of thirst There's not enough time to make that call Let's ditch this rider, shadow and all"" The sky was filled with the beautiful birds Still on the ground some crying was heard With his dime in his hand and his hand on the dial His ears were sweating as he forced a smile Hoofbeats beating across the range He rode through the night with his cup of change Tired and beaten, he fell into slumber But up in the sky they still had his number Up and down the old homestead The naked rider gallops through his head And although the moon isn't full He still feels the pull Still feels the pull Still feels the pull Still feels the pull Still feels the pull"

1974,"Let my love beat on (Like your blood, my friend) All of my love songs (Send them out again) Revel in music, let it take care of you If you don't like the story or end Well then pick up your pen And then write it again Listen, the voices you seek Are singing out in the street Crying out Come there with me Let your love beat on (After you are gone) All of your love songs (Plant them 'neath the sun) See how they sing on even when the seed is gone Spreading out and catching all Taking a hold of another one Listen, the voice in your head All you wish you had said When they were listening Sing it for me Will our love beat on (After we are gone?) Traveling beyond (What do we become?) Is there a reason love and song go on and on?"
Balanced on a Pin,It's a bauble Balanced on a pin This place I'm in The space I'm in We can talk you know We have a ways to go A ways to go A way to go What is that book you have? Is it a love story?

Don't be afraid 'cause I Can fly this plane I can land this plane Landing's the hardest part The connection comes apart It comes apart It all comes apart It's a bauble Balanced on a pin This place I'm in The space I'm in

Hawaii,(Come on in here) At first I didn't like him He came asking for a loan I got nervous when he came into view On an overdose of vitamins Trying to explain Something that I already knew He said help me stay afloat and get back to Hawaii Hawaii All the paintings and the sketches Lay scattered on the sand And the condominium was close at hand Things were getting hard to follow I was feeling pretty hollow When the stranger came to me and put out his hand He said I think we better talk there's something you don't understand About Hawaii Hawaii With my baby and my bicycle I up and rode away And many nights have passed since that morning came my way And I think about him often with his vitamins and kids Does he sleep with half a women on his mind?

Hitchhiker,"When I was a hitchhiker on the road I had to count on you But you needed me to ease the load And for conversation too Or did you just pass on through? You didn't see me in Toronto When I first tried out some hash Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again But I didn't have the cash I didn't have the cash Then I tried amphetamines And my head was in a glass Taped underneath the speedometer wires Of my 48 Buick's dash But I knew that wouldn't last Then came California When I first saw open water In the land of opportunity I knew I was getting hotter I knew I was getting hotter But the neon lights And the endless nights Fame took me by surprise The doctor gave me Valium But I still couldn't close my eyes I still couldn't close my eyes Then came paranoia And it ran away with me I would not sign my autograph Or appear on TV Or see or be seen Living in the country Looked good to me Smoking grass while the summer passed In a real organic scene Where everything was green Then we had a kid and we split apart I was living on the road And a little cocaine went a long, long way To ease that different load And my head did explode My head did explode I thought I was an Aztec Or a runner in Peru I could build such beautiful buildings To house the chosen few Like an Inca from Peru Now many years have come and gone Like friends and enemies I tried to leave my past behind But it's catching up with me It's catching up with me I don't know how I'm standing here Living in my life I'm thankful for my children And my faithful wife"

Cowboy Movie,"Me and my good partners We were riding back to our camp We were feeling very fine And the air was clear and slightly damp And we were riding back to have ourselves a party To celebrate the robbing of the train We were talking kind of low and lazy About not having to go out soon again You know we hadn't been back home two hours We heard a hawk cry out in the night And you know that's a signal from young Billy, who's our sentry He's saying something here ain't exactly right So we quick grabbed some of our hardware Stumbled out of our home In two minutes flat we had found her An Indian girl all alone And Eli said, ""Let's take her back to the cabin"" I said, ""You don't know she might be the law, yeah"" He said, smiling kind of nasty ""It ain't too damn likely she'll beat me to the draw."" As we were walking back through the darkness I heard the Duke, he's our dynamiter, say He said, ""What's your name, sweet little Indian girl?"" She said, ""Raven."" and she looked away Right then I didn't trust her, no and I said so, oh no Now, Eli, he's our fastest gunner He's kind of mean and young from the South He said, ""Fat Albert, you're getting kind of old and weird now."" ""You'd better get your twelve gauge shot gun right out."" And I did... Now Eli and the Duke they got down to it They each wanted the Indian girl for their own But when they finally got around to asking her You know she said she'd come to take young Billy home Eli said he'd kill young Billy He'd kill the Duke, and probably me too, yeah The Indian girl she said, ""Go ahead now do it"" I said ""Stop it"", and she bit my thumb nearly clean through And when they finally started to break down the door I smeared my face up with blood from my thumb I laid down on the floor and played real good possum You know I'm crazy but I ain't real dumb Now I'm dying here in Albuquerque I must be the sorriest sight you ever saw You know the reason I'm the only man here to tell it You know that Indian girl, she wasn't an Indian she was the law (Â© Guerrilla Music/BMI)"

The Wall Song,"You are walking, you've always been walking Stumbling half blinded and dry as the wind That strafes you and leaves you to lie in the sand And the wall stretches endless beside you to nowhere This wall that you've been trying to cross for years This fence made of fears that nobody hears You see a door, ah, such a great open door You know that your eyes telling lies, still you chance A shambling run, a ridiculous dance Like a scarecrow that's hung up to dry on a fence pole And there's a space-like vacuum waiting insidÐµ you For you to get through that one scrap of blue You scÐµnt the water, fresh green grass, food and water Your breath is scraping your brain into dust Your rusty old engine is ready to bust You cannot believe it that they would not trust you But the, but the door is wavering, is that your eyes? Are they still telling lies? What are lies?"

Peaceful Valley Boulevard,"One day shots rang out in the peaceful valley God was crying tears that fell like rain Before the railroad came from Kansas City And the bullets hit the bison from the train The first shots rang across the peaceful valley And the white man laid his foot upon the plain A wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon The settlers full of wonder as they crossed A gentle creek where two old oaks were standin' Before the west was won, there was a cost A rain of fire came down upon the wagons A mother screamed and every soul was lost Change hit the country like a thunderstorm Ancient rivers soon began to boil People rushed like water to California At first they came for gold and then for oil Fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes Mother Earth took poison in her soil An Electra Cruiser coasted towards the exit And turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard ""People make the difference"" read a billboard Above a long line of idling cars Who'll be the one to lead this world? Who'll be the beacon in the night? Who'll be the one to lead this world? Who'll be the beacon in the night? Who'll be the one to lead the nations And protect God's creations? A polar bear stood driftin' on an ice floe Sun beating down from the sky Politicians gathered for a summit And came away with nothing to decide Storms thundered on, his tears of falling rain A child was born and wondered why"

Someone's Gonna Rescue You,"Somewhere in the ray of sunshine, you find the dark Somehow when you see the spark it burns your heart Someone's gonna rescue you and bring you back Ah ah, ah ah I see you standing there, I hear you call But when you look at me, you don't see it all Someone's gonna rescue you before you fall Ah ah, ah ah No one can do the things you do Someone can save you You're scared of the way it goes sometimes in the night When it gets the best of you, you put up a fight Someone's gonna rescue you and make it right Someone's gonna rescue you Someone's gonna rescue you Someone's gonna rescue you"
By the Light of Common Day,By the light of common day Things look different Than they did in the starlit dark The dark was warm and clouded It was easy to deceive yourself And those around you in the work To say the craziness and pain The spreading of the stain is Exactly where you gain the spark to make it As if being happy isn't quite enough Somehow I needed to make it rough Rough enough to break it To make those long connections And run in wrong directions Till I break it loose I was wrong of course I see now The spark is there all the time now If you know how to listen to your calling The muse is quietly knocking on your door now To say the craziness and pain The spreading of the stain is Exactly where you gain the spark to make it As if being happy isnâ€™t quite enough Somehow I needed to make it rough Rough enough to break it Rough enough to break it You have to go faithfully each day And open up your head some way Somehow And what will come in answer Some strong and gentle dancer Will carry a song through your door Some great lifting force of light Will come to balance fearful night And raise its voice and then raise yours Raise its voice and then raise yours
Drive Out to the Desert,Drive out to the desert Sail out on the sea Far away from cities Where the light hides the sky Stars fear to fly And your eyes are finally free Find a space that's quiet And lie down on your back Ground and center In your head Till your troubles have fled And they've ceased their attack And if you start to feel very small That's a very good sign It means that your perception Your radio's reception Is working fine Look up and see Look up there with me This great magic ocean Stars like sand Thrown by someone's hand In one timeless motion And if you start to feel very small That's a very good sign It means that your perception Your radio's reception Is working fine Just fine
Look in Their Eyes,"Friend of the shadows He's wandering Knows no country No god or king You miss him when you're passing by You don't hear him when he cries But if you take a step closer There's a window to his life Look in his eyes (See him in the dark) What do you find? (Without a light, without a spark) Look in his eyes and see the dark She's holding her child The way your mother held you Is turning her around What you really wanna do? You miss her when she passes by You won't know it when she dies You'll never really see her Until you look into her eyes Look in her eyes (See the burning fire) What do you find? (Freedom is her one desire) Look in her eyes and see the fire Raft on a shore Tears in the surf Strangers in a strange land Surviving since birth You miss them when they pass you by They don't mean a thing to you But if you take a step backward It's your story, too Look in their eyes (Footprints in the sand) What do you find?

The City,"I first saw her as a child on the movie screen I felt my heart jump out of my chest She was damaged and lean With a character that puts your fortitude to the test Beauty by day, danger by night Ain't it a bitch to see That the only city I could ever really love Takes the time to step on people like me? Like a wind Like a flame She plays by the rules of her own game She can't lose You can't win All you can do is your best to stay in I hear an echo through a canyon of concrete Reflecting seas of lifeless eyes Watching ants toting hope home into their towers Stretching up towards the sky Somehow she moves me, somebody fooled me Into thinking she don't mean to be mean And the fact, though impractical, seems to be That she's somehow got a hold on me Like a wind Like a flame She plays by the rules of her own game She can't lose You can't win All you can do is your best to stay in Like a wind Like a flame She plays by the rules of her own game She can't lose You can't win All you can do is your best to stay in Leave a light on Leave a light on all night long Leave a light on Leave a light on all night long Leave a light on Leave a light on all night long"
The Us Below,"A billion burning suns Calmly do As they did before Like me and you Sitting in their place Bound, but years apart Stubborn as we are With matters of the heart Science, God and you All agree We've become something We weren't meant to be Paths run parallel Here and up above Distance held by hearts Afraid to open up Yet even though Our love burns slow It warms me And all around Sight and sound Inform me That we have found A common ground Like the stars Why must we be Eternally Alone? A finely diamond sky Jewels in everglow Illuminates the distance Between the us below Me here You there And in the middle The frozenness of fear Yet still we've found A common ground Like the stars Why must we be Eternally Alone?"
Things We Do for Love,Was it something she said About a dream she had?

Band Introductions,"I first read Seamus Heaney as a teenager, in the way a lot of teenagers probably do: in an educational anthology which tried to make poetry accessible and interesting for teenagers. It presented, and not without good reason, what is probably best known as the populist Heaney: the poet-as-farmer, delighting in the squelch and splash of the natural world, and occasionally extrapolating what he learns there onto the burden of being human. It was, for me, a bad introduction. I was fifteen, and much more engaged by the bright lights and the big city, as Jay McInerney put it. I was interested, or thought I was interested, more in the artificial electricity that runs from pylons to tenements than the coagulation of energy in the outside world, in amplified voices and electronic music than the divine harmony of the seasons, and in gutter-rats chasing up subway tunnels than the untameable ferocity of jaguars. Coming back to Heaney with a dubious but at least tangible handle on English-language poetry at the age of twenty-one, I realized two things: firstly, that his body of work encompassed far more than what the anthology had presented. Well, duh, you could fairly say, but I was fifteen. His first two collections, Death of a Naturalist from 1966 and Door into the Dark from 1969, are indeed rural-centric, but they cut much deeper than a lawnmower. Secondly, the poems are crafted with an extremely keen ear, which manages to bring the sound of the outside onto the printed page. Take the much-quoted and anthologized â€œBlackberry Pickingâ€. When Heaney reads the poem out, his accent renders the words onto that ethereal line between cacophony and pure natural harmony. The effect is not altogether lost in my own Received Pronunciation accent, or indeed in other varieties of English. Late August, given heavy rain and sun for a full week, the blackberries would ripen. At first, just one, a glossy purple clot among others, red, green, hard as a knot. You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger sent us out with milk-cans, pea-tins, jam-pots where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills we trekked and picked until the cans were full, until the tinkling bottom had been covered with green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered with thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's. We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre. But when the bath was filled we found a fur, A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache. The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush the fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour. I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair that all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot. Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not. The nature of blackberries as living, decaying things, and indeed the conflation of life and decay, is carefully, almost precariously positioned next to human activity and concerns: â€œYou ate that first oneâ€, â€œOur hands were pepperedâ€, â€œI hopedâ€. Itâ€™s probably fair to say that Heaney regarded some of Death of a Naturalist as apprentice work, as much of it is omitted in his compilations New Selected Poems: 1966-1987 and Opened Ground: Poems 1966-96. In a contemporary review of Wintering Out, Christopher Ricks wrote that Heaney would â€œhave to reconcile himself to the fact that Door into the Dark will consolidate him as the poet of muddy-booted blackberry-pickingâ€. His next collection, 1973â€™s Wintering Out , and to a greater extent 1975â€™s North , take on a more explicit social and political dimension, dealing not only with the current Troubles of Northern Ireland, but also with the history of British oppression of the Irish people. These concerns are held together in the poems alongside established concerns like the natural world and human existence, informing and explaining each other. In North, Heaney uses the form of the poems and the structure of the book to examine some of the most pressing political questions of the day. The volume largely consists of lyrics in quite a free mode of verse, until we get, foisted in the middle, â€œAct of Unionâ€, composed of two sonnets, rhymed, allowing for some phonetic license, in the English way: ababcdcdefefgg: II And I am still imperially Male, leaving you with the pain, The rending process in the colony, The battering ram, the boom burst from within. The act sprouted an obstinate fifth column Whose stance is growing unilateral. His heart beneath your heart is a wardrum Mustering force. His parasitical And ignorant little fists already Beat at your borders and I know they're cocked At me across the water. No treaty I foresee will salve completely your tracked And stretchmarked body, the big pain That leaves you raw, like opened ground, again. Itâ€™s extremely uncomfortable reading-- not just the sex, or the violence Heaney works into it, but the central conceit: sex as a metaphor for English colonization of Ireland. This is the first instance of Heaney using the phrase â€œopened groundâ€, which would later form the title of his most substantial collection; in a bookstore shelf it can easily be read to project the populist Heaney, but dig a little deeper and the phrase is much more uneasy, much more socially resonant.There has been critical disagreement over just how regular the sonnets are; to me, Heaney seems to mix strong, near-perfect rhymes with ones that feel deliberately forced (â€œpainâ€/ â€œwithinâ€) as part of the central conceit: this abrasive, monolithic and distinctly English sonnet which disrupts the natural rhythm of the volume. Heaney's formal approach can be contrasted with his contemporary Paul Muldoon: whilst Muldoon takes the sonnet and throws innovations at it from every angle, pushing hard at the concepts of rhyme, meter, volta, etc., Heaney takes what has proven a very flexible form and questions its normativity. Iâ€™m not best placed to judge the outcome of Heaneyâ€™s political poems; they were very well received outside of Ireland, but Irish critics have sometimes viewed them as profiting from misery. Another opinion, from the poet EilÃ©an NÃ­ ChuilleanÃ¡in, has pointed out that â€œthe inflexibility of the man and woman metaphorâ€ in â€œAct of Unionâ€ has â€œâ€˜something to do with the poetâ€™s sense of his audience. The heavy equations belong to a world of shared assumptions, not one in which poetry can make a single perception unique.â€ Probably my favorite Heaney poem is the opening one from The Haw Lantern , titled, tellingly plurally, â€œAlphabetsâ€. Its omniscient speaker details the process of a boy learning to communicate: in the first part with signs and gestures that slowly become letters, in the second, as a scholar struggling to learn Latin, and finally, in the third, as a confident man of letters who can use the power of language to travel to the moon and back. There he draws smoke with chalk the whole first week, Then draws the forked stick that they call a Y. This is writing. A swanâ€™s neck and swanâ€™s back Make the 2 he can see now as well as say. When he walked abroad. As from his small window The astronaut sees all that he has sprung from, The risen, aqueous, singular, lucent O Like a magnified and buoyant ovum - Or like my own wide pre-reflective stare All agog at the plasterer on his ladder Skimming our gable and writing our name there With his trowel point, letter by strange letter. Itâ€™s written in the quatrains that have served Heaney so well, and have helped to establish in his poetry a genealogy from Romanticism, which can help to account for his enduring popularity with readers enamoured by the variousness and fractiousness of modernism and its successors. In many ways, though, this poem stands thrillingly in opposition to the Romantic trope of lost innocence and youth: as the subject ages, his power with words increases until it begins to resemble sorcery, or at least rocket science. As Helen Vendler puts it, â€œAgainst Wordsworth's myth of a childhood radiance lost, the poem sets a counter-myth of an imaginative power that becomes fuller and freer with the child's expanding linguistic and literary power.â€ The off-rhymes, occasionally heightening to full ones, show off a confident literary swagger, the speaker and subject have become one, and possess an artistâ€™s linguistic palette not through some innate miracle, but through a hard, human, and realistic process. *** It's kind of strange, having covered all of this ground, to read from what would turn out to be Heaney's final collection, Human Chain . It includes lyrics of taut, metaphysical simplicity, such as this one, titled by its first line: Had I not been awake I would have missed it, A wind that rose and whirled until the roof Pattered with quick leaves off the sycamore And got me up, the whole of me a-patter, Alive and ticking like an electric fence: Had I not been awake I would have missed it It came and went too unexpectedly And almost it seemed dangerously, Hurtling like an animal at the house, A courier blast that there and then Lapsed ordinary. But not ever Afterwards. And not now. The poem inaugurates the collection's association of wind with the transience of life (and therefore, of course, death), but itâ€™s also a beautiful evocation of the moments we all feel, most of them probably quite transient to speak objectively, where weâ€™re blessed with a moment of clarity thatâ€™s almost beyond articulation. With the knots in our soul undone, the universe becomes pre-Copernican."

Johnny's Garden,There's a place I can get to Where I'm safe From the city blues And its green And its quiet Only trouble was I had to buy it And I'll do anything I got to do Cut my hair and shine my shoes chorus And keep on singin' the blues If I can stay here in Johnny's garden As the swift bird Flies over the grasses Dipping now and then To take his breakfast Thus I come and go And I travel And I can watch that bird And unravel Chorus -- With his love And his carin' He puts his life Into beauty sharin' And his children Are his flowers There to give us peace In quiet hours Chorus --

Down by the River - Live at the Cellar Door,"Be on my side. I'll be on your side There is no reason for you to hide It's so hard for me staying here all alone When you could be taking me for a ride She could drag me over the rainbow And send me away Down by the river I shot my baby Down by the river Dead, shot her dead Shot her dead You take my hand, I'll take your hand Together we may get away This much madness is too much sorrow It's impossible to make it today She could drag me over the rainbow And send me away Down by the river I shot my baby Down by the river Dead, shot here dead Shot her dead, ooh Shot her dead Be on my side, I'll be on your side There is no reason for you to hide It's so hard for me staying here all alone When you could be taking me for a ride"
Expecting to Fly - Live at the Cellar Door,"There you stood on the edge of your feather Expecting to fly While I laughed, I wondered whether I could wave goodbye Knowin' that you'd gone By the summer it was healing We had said goodbye All the years we'd spent with feeling Ended with a cry Babe, ended with a cry Babe, ended with a cry I tried so hard to stand As I stumbled and fell to the ground So hard to laugh as I fumbled And reached for the love I found Knowin' it was gone If I ever lived without you Now you know I'd die If I ever said I loved you Now you know I'd try Babe, now you know I'd try Babe, now you know I'd try Babe"
Flying on the Ground Is Wrong - Live at the Cellar Door,"Is my world not falling down?

After the Dolphin,"At the Dolphin the beer flowed like wine And people were drinking Over there there were lives on the line But not at the Dolphin Across the ocean the world was at war And bullets were flying In the air there's a plane headed for The heart of the Dolphin It's after the Dolphin They were laughing and drinking and carrying on And then in the blink of an eye they were gone, gone, gone So was the Dolphin So was the Dolphin Gone was the Dolphin What will become of us all? Who knows the story? Will we witness the final fall Of the hope and the glory? Blinded by honor they fought eye to eye Now men without faces rain fire from the sky When you kill from a distance is anyone to blame? And the armies of warfare will never be the same again After the Dolphin After the Dolphin After the Dolphin After the Dolphin After the Dolphin After the Dolphin ..."
Arrows,"Arrows turned inward are good for the soul I have a thing about arrows And diamonds and coal Pressure turning carbon to jewels Slowly they aim at my iron mark Flaming healing arrows They beat at my heart Angels turning metal to tools I don't care what you think has got you down You can turn it around I don't care what you think turn it around Turn it around, turn it around The times that I knew I could never get through That's when I grew up the most And alone sounds so sad But alone I found the best friend I had I don't care what you think has got you down You can turn it around I don't care what you think turn it around Turn it around, turn it around Arrows turned inward are good for the soul Piercing through every callus They always get through My target is a heart no-one fools Turn it around, turn it around ..."
Haven't We Lost Enough?,I was with you you were alone Now I'm standing here Wisdom came only after you'd gone So I'm starting all over with a tear in my eye I just never thought that you'd disappear In the night your image arises Close behind comes the pain I hope I'm dreaming 'cos it hurts so bad When I reach out for you I'm alone in some room I just never thought that you'd disappear I still love you Like a child wasn't I good enough? I still want you Drives me wild Haven't we had it rough? Haven't we lost enough? Time heals all so they say I don't know Sometimes nothing is clear Maybe someday I'll understand But I know for a start there's a place in my heart That is yours and it won't disappear I still love you Like a child wasn't I good enough? I still want you Drives me wild Haven't we had it rough? I still love you Like a child wasn't I good enough? I still want you Drives me wild Haven't we had it rough? Haven't we lost enough?
House of Broken Dreams,Living in a house of broken dreams Where shadows throw shadows on the wall And memories are mountains to climb Knowing everyone can fall And here where the cobwebs count the hours Since we let the laughter clear the air Painfully trying to touch Knowing that we used to care Separate houses separate hearts It's hard to face the feelings tearing us apart And in this house of broken dreams love lies Can we keep our castles in the air While we're keeping both feet on the ground? 'Cos if your heart can touch another heart Love can turn it all around Get rid of those empty glances and empty sighs Or tears of longing will fill your eyes In this house of broken dreams love hides
If Anybody Had a Heart,"If anybody had a heart Yours would never be broken If anybody had a heart like mine In this world of right and wrong The hardest part is beginning And by the time you get where you belong You're either losing or winning Well, I don't know how but people seem to know When you want somebody bad enough Ah, well I want you now and wherever you go I'm gonna love you till you've had enough If anybody had a heart Yours would never be broken If anybody had a heart like mine Some people treat you like the clothes you wear They only see what you show them Just let them talk baby I don't care They don't know where we're going But I love you so much and I have for so long How could anybody doubt it? Ah, just one little touch and my love is so strong Baby, how can we live without it? If anybody had a heart Yours would never be broken If anybody had a heart like mine When you love somebody You might stumble, you might fall If you love somebody hard enough You might just get it all If anybody had a heart Yours would never be broken If anybody had a heart like mine If anybody had a heart Yours would never be broken If anybody had a heart like mine If anybody had a heart Yours would never be broken If anybody had a heart like mine"

No Tears Left,"So things have gotten weird for you The foolish do the things they do Mostly talk right at you without speaking They're deaf and blind and they cannot think But now they want to be your shrink Probing for the missing link and freaking And it's all about how you got strange Indifferent to their fear of change And feeling strong enough to get you peaking It's my life and I have no tears left It's my life and I ain't done yet What do I have left? And you rage at their transparency And total insincerity That love is why they have to try and help you But mostly it's about control They're terrified that you might go And find out for yourself what they can't teach you It's my life, I got no tears left It's my life and I ain't done yet What do I have left? Generations that go through this The young are punished for their disregard For every fool who might want to lead them But living in the here and now Will cleans the waste of sacred cows That clutters up the past you might be seeking So go ahead and rage and fight Insist on finding your own light As wisdom cannot be confused by freedom It's my life, I got no tears left It's my life, I ain't done yet It's my life, I got no tears left It's my life, well, I ain't done yet What the hell do I have left?"
Out of Control,"Once, high on a hill, there was a song Nothing was wrong, that's when time stood still Now lovers are caught, tied in their dreams Bound in their thoughts, wrapped in the depth of their love If I can hold on to you If I can hold on to you Somewhere near the end, lovers pretend Fake what they feel, take what they get from love Start missing the drive, staying alive Four out of five, without the feeling of love If the sky is fire and hell is blue If all of our dreams won't come true If the sky is fire and hell is blue I'll cover you, I'll cover you Sky is fire, hell is blue Sky is fire, hell is blue That's why I'm out of control Tear myself down, build myself up, tear myself down again I'm talking to you, trying to get through Don't want to hide, lost in the mirror of love"

Feed the People,Why not feed the people everywhere And let the peace begin? Turn your swords to ploughshares everywhere And feed the people When they borrow in third world countries people need to be fed So explain this to politicians while we send them guns instead Of the seeds that they're planting in the ground Making their own way Self sufficient without permission from the good old usa But it seems they owe us a lot of money And do you know what for? Cause the friends of senator arrogant made a killing on this civil war Chorus It is hard to raise an army when your children are all fed They got no motivation for making other people dead Even with governmentt persuasion of the most compelling kind Give them a choice they'll be looking at you as if you'd lost your mind But then all of this craziness It will not go away Till we stop feeding hatred with embargoes and blockades Why take the time to worry About anybody else? Maybe talk about them Wonder how they felt Caught in the cross fire of someone else's fight What is wrong? Nobody's right All religions and ideologies Suffer from the truth Until lies become reality When the people start to shoot Got a whole lot to answer for But who are we to judge? Common sense and enough to eat Can settle any grudge When the kindness of strangers It means no disrespect Being honest with the help you give Means there's nothing to expect Chorus
Hearts Gate,"People find love the way they do Ain't the same for any two If you think you get to choose, there's heartbreak It takes paying attention to divine intervention Trust the decision your heart makes In the tropical moonlight where the air feels like velvet Only someone to share it was missing My heart was feeling bolder, would she turn a deaf shoulder My mind getting older by the minute It was hard to sit & wait, look at the stars, ponder my fate Is to fear was it too late for the risking Now we've had a few years, we're working out our fears Lots of laughter & tears & growing We left room to be ourselves, got the hand we'd been dealt And there's nobody else need know it People find love the way they do Ain't the same for any two We get chosen, we don't choose at the heart's gate If you're paying attention to divine intervention Comes a glorious ascension you both make At the heart's gate"

Spanish Suite,"Cuando sientes que tu amor Va saliendo de tu vida Y nunca regresarÃ¡ Cuando ella diga Adios y buena suerte No estoy interesada Tu amor no vale nada (when you feel that your love Is going out of your life And will never come back When she says Goodbye and good luck I am not interested Your love is worth nothing) There comes a time when love becomes a trial And some they will survive And some are sure to fail No matter what you do It's not enough, for she Is as sure as she can be That she no longer cares to love you So go on alone, your future is your own For she has told you now The time has come to follow different paths How long will it take you to forget her? How long for the love to finally die? How long will the spirit live within you? Help me, I can no longer cry (trumpet) So take your life in hand And live it day by day One moment at a time Ã‚â‚¬ËœTil death comes to collect you Remember all the love, beyond just simple caring Obsessively compelling But ultimately so telling Y parece Que sabÃ­as que algÃºn dÃ­a Iba a vivir Ese momento ya pasado No mientas Ya no llores por tu amor La vida continÃºa Olvida tu dolor, hermano mÃ­o Todo todo ha pasado Estaba destinado (and it seems You knew that some time I was going to live The moment had already passed Don't lie Don't cry for your love Life goes on Forget your pain, my brother Everything is over It's already been written) It took me too much time to realize that it was over There was no more me and you Now my life has changed completely There's an empty place that once belonged to you (yeah) I gave up on you That's the hardest thing I've ever had to do Giving up on you I gave up on you I have nothing left to lose Even though I know you'll never really face yourself or put your trust in someone else That's just the same as asking all of us to turn away and just give up on you Every day is different for me now The air is clear, and the daily worry too (all the time) Easier to repossess my confidence was weak I was trapped in loving you I gave up on you Even with the sadness it would surely bring I gave up on you I gave up on you Even knowing what I do I was giving up the pain of living without you My life will never be the same So I will once again do as you wish give up on you I feel so common now My love of decades, (won't you really pass too late?) Hatreds born of demons must be driven from destruction Now must fight for its own sake I gave up on you I'd no more time to waste I gave up on you I'd harder things to face I gave up on you I've finished with the chase I gave up on you While I can still forget the bitter taste And memories that overcome me Seeming to be trying to convince me That life is nothing but a time to waste I gave up on you"
Act of Love,"The fruit of love was in the future Around the corner and over the hill The act of love was slowly pounding Slowly pounding, slowly pounding The holy war was slowly building Heroes leaving for the great crusade Seek reward in the ever after Ever after, ever after Don't wanna have to lose you, baby Don't want to have to take you back You know I'll never lose you, baby Abuse you baby, use you baby You know I'll always help you baby But I just can't do that I know I said I'd help you baby Here's my wallet, call me sometime Act of love Act of love Act of love Act of love The fruit of love was in the future Around the corner and over the hill The act of love was slowly pounding Slowly pounding, slowly pounding Act of love Act of love Act of love Act of love"
Big Green Country,"Across the plain flew the lone grey rider Leather bag pounding on his back Above the clouds the moon was climbing higher A pack of wolves wanted their money back With folded arms, the chief stood watching Painted braves slipped down the hill In his ears, the spirit talking As they closed in for an easy kill At the house the door was wide open Wind blew curtains off the rod She was waiting and hoping She was praying to her god He was luckier than most men He was barely in his prime As she stood there in the doorway Her long dress flowing, would he make it this time? Over the hill in the big green country That's the place where the cancer cowboy rides Pure as the driven snow before it got him Sometimes I feel like he's all right Sometimes I feel like a piece of paper Sometimes I feel like my own name Sometimes I feel different later Sometimes I feel, I feel just the same"

I'm the Ocean,"I'm an accident, I was driving way too fast Couldn't stop though, so I let the moment last I'm for rolling, I'm for tossing in my sleep It's not guilt though, it's not the company I keep People my age, they don't do the things I do They go somewhere while I run away with you And I've got my friends, and I've got my children too And I got her love, she's got my love too I can't hear you, but I feel the things you say I can't see you, but I see what's in my way Now I'm floating, 'cause I'm not tied to the ground Words I've spoken seem to leave a hollow sound On the long plain, see the rider in the night See the chieftain, see the braves in cool moonlight Who will love them when they take another life? Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife? Voicemail numbers on an old computer screen Rows of lovers, parked forever in a dream Screaming sirens echoing across the bay To the old boats from the city far away Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns Rows of zeros on a field that's turning brown They play baseball, they play football under lights They play card games and we watch them every night Need distraction, need romance and candlelight Need random violence, need entertainment tonight Need the evidence, want the testimony of Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love I was too tired to see the news when I got home Pulled the curtain, fell into bed alone Started dreaming, saw the rider once again In the doorway, where she stood and watched for him Watched for him I'm not present, I'm a drug that makes you dream I'm an Aerostar, I'm a Cutlass Supreme In the wrong lane, trying to turn against the flow I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow (I'm the ocean) (I'm the ocean) I'm the giant undertow (I'm the ocean) I'm the giant undertow (I'm the ocean) (I'm the ocean) (I'm the ocean) (I'm the ocean) (I'm the ocean) (I'm the ocean)"

Throw Your Hatred Down,"Here in the conscious world we place our theories down Why man must bring us to our knees Before he sees the weakness of his sinful plan The power in his hand will never touch a friend Throw your hatred down Throw your hatred down Meanwhile in the underworld the weaknesses are seen By peasants and presidents who plan the counter-scheme Children in the schoolyard finish choosing teams Divided by their dreams while a TV screams Throw your weapons down Throw your weapons down The wheel of fortune keeps on rolling down The street that's paved with sinful plans There but for circumstance may go you or I Dressed in gold lame, find a place to stay Throw your hatred down Throw your hatred down Throw your hatred down Throw your weapons down"

Here We Are in the Years,Now that the holidays have come They can relax and watch the sun Rise above all of the beautiful things they've done Go to the country take the dog Look at the sky without the smog See the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogs Eat hot dogs What a pity That the people from the city Can't relate to the slower things That the country brings Time itself is bought and sold The spreading fear of growing old Contains a thousand foolish games that we play While people planning trips to stars Allow another boulevard To claim a quiet country lane It's insane So the subtle face is a loser this time around Here we are in the years Where the showman shifts the gears Lives become careers Children cry in fear Let us out of here

Lookin' for a Love,I've been lookin' for a lover but I haven't met her yet She'll be nothing like I pictured her to be In her eyes I will discover another reason why I want to live and make the best of what I see Where the sun hits the water and the mountains meet the sand There's a beach that I walk along sometimes And maybe there I'll meet her and we'll start to say hello And never stop to think of any other time Lookin' for a love that's right for me I don't know how long it's gonna be But I hope I treat her kind and don't mess with her mind When she starts to see the darker side of me Lookin' for a love that's right for me I don't know how long it's gonna be But I hope I treat her kind and don't mess with her mind When she starts to see the darker side of me I've been lookin' for a lover but I haven't met her yet She'll be nothing like I pictured her to be In her eyes I will discover another reason why I want to live and make the best of what I see Ah ah ah Ah ah ah Ah ah ah When she starts to see the darker side of me

Thrasher - Live at The Boarding House,"They were hiding behind hay bales They were planting in the full moon They had given all they had For something new But the light of day was on them They could see the thrashers coming And the water shone like diamonds In the dew And I was just getting up Hit the road before it's light Trying to catch an hour on the sun When I saw those thrashers rollin' by Looking more than two lanes wide I was feeling like my day had just begun Where the eagle glides descending There's an ancient river bending Through the timeless gorge of changes Where sleeplessness awaits I searched out my companions They were lost in crystal canyons When the aimless blade of science Slashed the pearly gates Then I knew that I'd had enough Burned my credit card for fuel Headed out to where the asphalt turns to sand With a one-way ticket to the land of truth And my suitcase in my hand How I lost my friends I still don't understand They had the best selection They were poisoned with protection There was nothing that they needed They had nothing left to find They were lost in rock formations Or became park bench mutations On the sidewalks and in the stations They were waiting, waiting Well, I got bored and left them there They were just dead weight to me Better down the road without that load Brings back the time when I was eight or nine I was watching my mama's TV It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode Where the vulture glides descending On an asphalt highway bending Through libraries and museums Galaxies and stars Down the windy halls of friendship To the rose clipped by the bullwhip The motel of lost companions Waits with heated pool and bar But me I'm not stopping there Got my own row left to hoe Just another line in the field of time When the thrasher comes I'll be stuck in the sun Like the dinosaurs in shrines But I'll know the time has come to give what's mine Thank you Today's better than yesterday"

Theme From Pastoral,"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies. In fact, I think we'd be fooling ourselves if we had an audience this large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present. This afternoon we want to talk about the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet explains itself. But before we get into it, since this is the year of the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify some things that refer to me personally, concerning my own personal position. I'm still a Muslim. That is, my religion is still Islam. My religion is still Islam. I still credit Mr. Muhammad for what I know and what I am. He's the one who opened my eyes. At present I am the minister of the newly founded Muslim Mosque Incorporated, which has its offices in the Theresa Hotel right in the heart of Harlem, that's the black belt in New York City. And when we realize that Adam Clayton Powell, is a Christian minister, he has Abyssinian Baptist Church, but at the same time he's more famous for his political struggling. And Dr. King is a Christian minister from Atlanta Georgia, or in Atlanta Georgia, but he's become more famous for being involved in the civil rights struggle. There's another in New York, Rev. Galamison, I don't know if you've heard of him out here, he's a Christian minister from Brooklyn, but has become famous for his fight against the segregated school system in Brooklyn. Rev. Cleage, right here, is a Christian minister, here in Detroit, he's head of the Freedom Now Party. All of these are Christian ministers â€¦all of these are Christian ministers but they don't come to us as Christian ministers, they come to us as fighters in some other category. I am a Muslim minister. The same as they are Christian ministers, I'm a Muslim minister. And I don't believe in fighting today on any one front, but on all fronts. In fact, I'm a Black Nationalist freedom fighter. Islam is my religion but I believe my religion is my personal business. It governs my personal life, my personal morals. And my religious philosophy is personal between me and the God in whom I believe, just as the religious philosophy of these others is between them and the God in whom they believe. And this is best this way. Were we to come out here discussing religion, we'd have too many differences from the out start and we could never get together. So today, though Islam is my religious philosophy, my political, economic and social philosophy is black nationalism. You and I â€“ As I say, if we bring up religion, we'll have differences, we'll have arguments, and we'll never be able to get together. But if we keep our religion at home, keep our religion in the closet, keep our religion between ourselves and our God, but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us. The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community. The time when white people can come in our community and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long gone. By the same token, the time when that same white man, knowing that your eyes are too far open, can send another Negro in the community, and get you and me to support him, so that he can use him to lead us astray, those days are long gone too. The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that if you and I are going to live in a black community â€“ and that's where we're going to live, 'cause as soon as you move into one of theirâ€¦.soon as you move out of the black community into their community, it's mixed for a period of time, but they're gone and you're right there all by yourself again. We must, we must understand the politics of our community and we must know what politics is supposed to produce. We must know what part politics play in our lives. And until we become politically mature, we will always be misled, led astray, or deceived or maneuvered into supporting someone politically who doesn't have the good of our community at heart. So the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program, a political program, of reeducation â€“ to open our people's eyes, make us become more politically conscious, politically mature. And then, we will â€“ whenever we are ready to cast our ballot, that ballot will be cast for a man of the community, who has the good of the community at heart. The economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we should own and operate and control the economy of our community. You would never have foundâ€”you can't open up a black store in a white community. White man won't even patronize you. And he's not wrong. He got sense enough to look out for himself. It's you who don't have sense enough to look out for yourself. The white man, the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community. But you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses, under the pretext that you want to integrate. Nah, you're out of your mind. The political â€¦ the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to become involved in a program of reeducation, to educate our people into the importance of knowing that when you spend your dollar out of the community in which you live, the community in which you spend your money becomes richer and richer, the community out of which you take your money becomes poorer and poorer. And because these Negroes, who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, the Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer. And then what happens? The community in which you live becomes a slum. It becomes a ghetto. The conditions become rundown. And then you have the audacity to complain about poor housing in a rundown community, while you're running down yourselves when you take your dollar out. And you and I are in a double trap because not only do we lose by taking our money someplace else and spending it, when we try and spend it in our own community we're trapped because we haven't had sense enough to set up stores and control the businesses of our community. The man who is controlling the stores in our community is a man who doesn't look like we do. He's a man who doesn't even live in the community. So you and I, even when we try and spend our money on the block where we live or the area where we live, we're spending it with a man who, when the sun goes down, takes that basket full of money in another part of the town. So we're trapped, trapped, double-trapped, triple-trapped. Any way we go, we find that we're trapped. Any every kind of solution that someone comes up with is just another trap. But the political and economic philosophy of black nationalismâ€¦the economic philosophy of black nationalism shows our people the importance of setting up these little stores, and developing them and expanding them into larger operations. Woolworth didn't start out big like they are today; they started out with a dime store, and expanded, and expanded, and expanded until today they are all over the country and all over the world and they getting some of everybody's money. Now this is what you and I â€“ General Motors, the same way, it didn't start out like it is. It started out just a little rat-race type operation. And it expanded and it expanded until today it's where it is right now. And you and I have to make a start. And the best place to start is right in the community where we live. So our people not only have to be reeducated to the importance of supporting black business, but the black man himself has to be made aware of the importance of going into business. And once you and I go into business, we own and operate at least the businesses in our community. What we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community. And once you can create some employment in the community where you live, it will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully, boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job. Anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job, you're in bad shape. When you â€” and he is your enemy. You wouldn't be in this country if some enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here. On the other hand, some of you think you came here on the Mayflower. So as you can see, brothers and sisters, today â€“ this afternoon it is not our intention to discuss religion. We're going to forget religion. If we bring up religion we'll be in an argument. And the best way to keep away from arguments and differences, as I said earlier, put your religion at home, in the closet, keep it between you and your God. Because if it hasn't done anything more for you than it has, you need to forget it anyway. Whether you are a Christian or a Muslim or a nationalist, we all have the same problem. They don't hang you because you're a Baptist; they hang you 'cause you're black. They don't attack me because I'm a Muslim. They attack me 'cause I'm black. They attacked all of us for the same reason. All of us catch hell from the same enemy. We're all in the same bag, in the same boat. We suffer political oppression, economic exploitation and social degradation. All of 'em from the same enemy. The government has failed us. You can't deny that. Any time you're living in the 20th century, 1964, and you walking around here singing ""We Shall Overcome,"" the government has failed you. This is part of what's wrong with you, you do too much singing. Today it's time to stop singing and start swinging. You can't sing up on freedom. But you can swing up on some freedom. Cassius Clay can sing. But singing didn't help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Swinging helped him. So this government has failed us. The government itself has failed us. And the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us. And once we see that all of these other sources to which we've turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves. We need a self-help program, a do-it-yourself philosophy, a do-it-right-now philosophy, a it's-already-too-late philosophy. This is what you and I need to get with. And the only time â€“ the only way we're going to solve our problem is with a self-help program. Before we can get a self-help program started, we have to have a self-help philosophy. Black nationalism is a self-help philosophy. What's so good about it â€“ you can stay right in the church where you are and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. You can stay in any kind of civic organization that you belong to and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. You can be an atheist and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. This is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division and argument, 'cause if you're black, you should be thinking black. And if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, I'm sorry for you. Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude it changes your behavior pattern. And then you go on into some action. As long as you got a sit-down philosophy you'll have a sit-down thought pattern. And as long as you think that old sit-down thought, you'll be in some kind of sit-down action. They'll have you sitting in everywhere. It's not so good to refer to what you're going to do as a sit-in. That right there castrates you. Right there it brings you down. What goes with it? What â€“ think of the image of someone sitting. An old woman can sit. An old man can sit. A chump can sit, a coward can sit, anything can sit. Well, you and I been sitting long enough and it's time for us today to start doing some standing and some fighting to back that up. When we look at other parts of this Earth upon which we live, we find that black, brown, red and yellow people in Africa and Asia are getting their independence. They're not getting it by singing, 'We Shall Overcome."" No, they're getting it through nationalism. It is nationalism that brought about the independence of the people in Asia. Every nation in Asia gained its independence through the philosophy of nationalism. Every nation on the African continent that has gotten its independence brought it about through the philosophy of nationalism. And it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years. America is just as much a colonial power as England ever was. America is just as much a colonial power as France ever was. In fact, America is more so a colonial power than they, because she is a hypocritical colonial power behind it. What is 20th â€” what, what do you call second-class citizenship? Why, that's colonization. Second-class citizenship is nothing but 20th slavery. How you gonna to tell me you're a second-class citizen? They don't have second-class citizenship in any other government on this Earth. They just have slaves and people who are free! Well, this country is a hypocrite! They try and make you think they set you free by calling you a second-class citizen. No, you're nothing but a 20th century slave. Just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from Asia and Africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country. And 1964 looks like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet. Why does it look like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet? Because Negroes have listened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long, and they're fed up. They've become disenchanted. They've become disillusioned. They've become dissatisfied. And all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent. Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous. And in 1964, this seems to be the year. Because what can the white man use, now, to fool us? After he put down that March on Washington â€“ and you see all through that now, he tricked you, had you marching down to Washington. Had you marching back and forth between the feet of a dead man named Lincoln and another dead man named George Washington, singing, ""We Shall Overcome."" He made a chump out of you. He made a fool out of you. He made you think you were going somewhere and you end up going nowhere but between Lincoln and Washington. So today our people are disillusioned. They've become disenchanted. They've become dissatisfied. And in their frustrations they want action. And in 1964 you'll see this young black man, this new generation, asking for the ballot or the bullet. That old Uncle Tom action is outdated. The young generation don't want to hear anything about ""the odds are against us."" What do we care about odds? When this country here was first being founded, there were thirteen colonies. The whites were colonized. They were fed up with this taxation without representation. So some of them stood up and said, ""Liberty or death!"" I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington â€“ wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. ""Liberty or death"" is was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English. They didn't care about the odds. Why, they faced the wrath of the entire British Empire. And in those days, they used to say that the British Empire was so vast and so powerful that the sun would never set on it. This is how big it was, yet these thirteen little scrawny states, tired of taxation without representation, tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded, told that big British Empire, ""Liberty or death."" And here you have 22 million Afro-Americans, black people today, catching more hell than Patrick Henry ever saw. And I'm here to tell you in case you don't know it â€“ that you got a new, you got a new generation of black people in this country who don't care anything whatsoever about odds. They don't want to hear you ol' Uncle Tom, handkerchief-heads talking about the odds. No! This is a new generation. If they're going to draft these young black men, and send them over to Korea or to South Vietnam to face 800 million Chineseâ€¦ If you're not afraid of those odds, you shouldn't be afraid of these odds. Why is America â€“ why does this loom to be such an explosive political year? Because this is the year of politics. This is the year when all of the white politicians are going to come into the Negro community. You never see them until election time. You can't find them until election time. They're going to come in with false promises. And as they make these false promises they're going to feed our frustrations, and this will only serve to make matters worse. I'm no politician. I'm not even a student of politics. I'm not a Republican, nor a Democrat, nor an American â€“ and got sense enough to know it. I'm one of the 22 million black victims of the Democrats. One of the 22 million black victims of the Republicans and one of the 22 million black victims of Americanism. And when I speak, I don't speak as a Democrat or a Republican, nor an American. I speak as a victim of America's so-called democracy. You and I have never seen democracy â€“ all we've seen is hypocrisy. When we open our eyes today and look around America, we see America not through the eyes of someone who has enjoyed the fruits of Americanism. We see America through the eyes of someone who has been the victim of Americanism. We don't see any American dream. We've experienced only the American nightmare. We haven't benefited from America's democracy. We've only suffered from America's hypocrisy. And the generation that's coming up now can see it. And are not afraid to say it. If you go to jail, so what? If you're black, you were born in jail. If you black you were born in jail, in the North as well as the South. Stop talking about the South. As long as you south of the Canadian border, you South. Don't call Governor Wallace a Dixie governor, Romney is a Dixie Governor. Twenty-two million black victims of Americanism are waking up and they are gaining a new political consciousness, becoming politically mature. And as they become â€“ develop this political maturity, they're able to see the recent trends in these political elections. They see that the whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again. Which means that any block, any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position. Either way you go, that's who gets it. You're in a position to determine who'll go to the White House and who'll stay in the doghouse. You're the one who has that power. You can keep Johnson in Washington D.C., or you can send him back to his Texas cotton patch. You're the one who sent Kennedy to Washington. You're the one who put the present Democratic administration in Washington, D.C. The whites were evenly divided. It was the fact that you threw 80 percent of your votes behind the Democrats that put the Democrats in the White House. When you see this, you can see that the Negro vote is the key factor. And despite the fact that you are in a position to be the determining factor, what do you get out of it? The Democrats have been in Washington, D.C. only because of the Negro vote. They've been down there four years. And they're â€“ all other legislation they wanted to bring up they've brought it up, and gotten it out of the way, and now they bring up you. And now they bring up you! You put them first and they put you last. Because you're a chump! A political chump. In Washington, D.C., in the House of Representatives there are 257 who are Democrats. Only 177 are Republican. In the Senate there are 67 Democrats. Only 33 are Republicans. The party that you backed controls two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate and still they can't keep their promise to you. 'Cause you're a chump. Any time you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election-time, and you're dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party, you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to your race. What kind of alibi do come up with? They try and pass the buck to the Dixiecrats. Now, back during the days when you were blind, deaf and dumb, ignorant, politically immature, naturally you went along with that. But today, as your eyes come open, and you develop political maturity, you're able to see and think for yourself, and you can see that a Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat â€“ in disguise. You look at the structure of the government that controls this country, is controlled by 16 senatorial committees and 20 congressional committees. Of the 16 senatorial committees that run the government, 10 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists. Of the 20 congressional committees that run the government, 12 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists. And they're going to tell you and me that the South lost the war? You, today, are in the hands of a government of segregationists. Racists, white supremacists, who belong to the Democratic party but disguise themselves as Dixiecrats. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat. Whoever runs the Democrats is also the father of the Dixiecrats. And the father of all of them is sitting in the White House. I say, and I'll say it again, you got a president who's nothing but a southern segregationist from the state of Texas. They'll lynch in Texas as quick as they'll lynch you in Mississippi. Only in Texas they lynch you with a Texas accent, in Mississippi they lynch you with a Mississippi accent. The first thing the cracker does when he comes in power, he takes all the Negro leaders and invites them for coffee. To show that he's all right. And those Uncle Toms can't pass up the coffee. They come away from the coffee table telling you and me that this man is all right . 'Cause he's from the South and since he's from the South he can deal with the South. Look at the logic that they're using. What about Eastland? He's from the South. Why not make him the president? If Johnson is a good man 'cause he's from Texas, and being from Texas will enable him to deal with the South, Eastland can deal with the South better than Johnson! Oh, I say you been misled. You been had. You been took. I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago while the senators were filibustering and I noticed in the back of the Senate a huge map, and on this map it showed the distribution of Negroes in America. And surprisingly, the same senators that were involved in the filibuster were from the states where there were the most Negroes. Why were they filibustering the civil rights legislation? Because the civil rights legislation is supposed to guarantee boarding rights to Negroes from those states. And those senators from those states know that if the Negroes in those states can vote, those senators are down the drain. The representatives of those states go down the drain. And in the Constitution of this country it has a stipulation, wherein, whenever the rights, the voting rights of people in a certain district are violated, then the representative who's from that particular district, according to the Constitution, is supposed to be expelled from the Congress. Now, if this particular aspect of the Constitution was enforced, why, you wouldn't have a cracker in Washington, D.C. But what would happen? When you expel the Dixiecrat, you're expelling the Democrat. When you destroy the power of the Dixiecrat, you are destroying the power of the Democratic Party. So how in the world can the Democratic Party in the South actually side with you, in sincerity, when all of its power is based in the South? These Northern Democrats are in cahoots with the southern Democrats. They're playing a giant con game, a political con game. You know how it goes. One of 'em comes to you and make believe he's for you. And he's in cahoots with the other one that's not for you. Why? Because neither one of 'em is for you. But they got to make you go with one of 'em or the other. So this is a con game, and this is what they've been doing with you and me all of these years. First thing, Johnson got off the plane when he become president, he ask, ""Where's Dickey?"" You know who Dickey is? Dickey is old southern cracker Richard Russell. Lookie here! Yes, Lyndon B. Johnson's best friend is the one who is a head, who's heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation. You tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson's best friend? How can Johnson be his friend and your friend too? No, that man is too tricky. Especially if his friend is still ol' Dickey. Whenever the Negroes keep the Democrats in power they're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. This is true! A vote for a Democrat is nothing but a vote for a Dixiecrat. I know you don't like me saying that. I'm not the kind of person who come here to say what you like. I'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not. Up here in the North you have the same thing. The Democratic Party don't â€“ they don't do it that way. They got a thing they call gerrymandering. They maneuver you out of power. Even though you can vote they fix it so you're voting for nobody. They got you going and coming. In the South they're outright political wolves, in the North they're political foxes. A fox and a wolf are both canine, both belong to the dog family. Now, you take your choice. You going to choose a northern dog or a southern dog? Because either dog you choose, I guarantee you, you'll still be in the doghouse. This is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody. America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, revolutions are bloody, oh yes they are. They have never had a bloodless revolution. Or a non-violent revolution. That don't happen even in Hollywood You don't have a revolution in which you love your enemy. And you don't have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it. Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems. A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. She's the only country in history, in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless revolution. The Russian Revolution was bloody, Chinese Revolution was bloody, French Revolution was bloody, Cuban Revolution was bloody. And there was nothing more bloody than the American Revolution. But today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything. I hope that the white man can see this. 'Cause if you don't see it you're finished. If you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance. We don't care anything about your atomic bomb; it's useless, because other countries have atomic bombs. When two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them. So it means that the white man today is without a weapon. If you want some action you've got to come on down to Earth, and there's more black people on Earth than there are white people. I only got a couple more minutes. The white man can never win another war on the ground. His days of war â€“ victory â€“ his days of battleground victory are over. Can I prove it? Yes. Take all the action that's going on this Earth right now that he's involved in. Tell me where he's winning â€“ nowhere. Why, some rice farmers, some rice farmers! Some rice-eaters ran him out of Korea, yes they ran him out of Korea. Rice-eaters, with nothing but gym shoes and a rifle and a bowl of rice, took him and his tanks and his napalm and all that other action he's supposed to have and ran him across the Yalu. Why? Because the day that he can win on the ground has passed. Up in French Indochina, those little peasants, rice-growers, took on the might of the French army and ran all the Frenchmen, you remember Dien Bien Phu! The same thing happened in Algeria, in Africa. They didn't have anything but a rifle. The French had all these highly mechanized instruments of warfare. But they put some guerilla action on. And a white man can't fight a guerilla warfare. Guerilla action takes heart, take nerve, and he doesn't have that. He's brave when he's got tanks. He's brave when he's got planes. He's brave when he's got bombs. He's brave when he's got a whole lot of company along with him. But you take that little man from Africa and Asia; turn him loose in the woods with a blade. A blade. That's all he needs. All he needs is a blade. And when the sun comes down â€“ goes down and it's dark, it's even-Stephen. So it's the, it's the ballot or the bullet. Today, our people can see that we're faced with a government conspiracy. This government has failed us. The senators who are filibustering concerning your and my rights, that's the government. Don't say it's southern senators, this is the government. This is a government filibuster. It's not a segregationist filibuster, it's a government filibuster. Any kind of activity that takes place on the floor of the Congress or the Senate, that's the government. Any kind of dilly-dallying, that's the government. Any kind of pussy-footing, that's the government. Any kind of act that's designed to delay or deprive you and me, right now, of getting full rights, that's the government that's responsible. And anytime you find the government involved in a conspiracy to violate the citizenship or the civil rights of a people in 1964, then you are wasting your time going to that government expecting redress. Instead you have to take that government to the world court and accuse it of genocide and all of the other crimes that it is guilty of today. So those of us whose political and economic and social philosophy is black nationalism have become involved in the civil rights struggle. We have injected ourselves into the civil rights struggle. And we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights. As long as you fight it on the level of civil rights, you're under Uncle Sam's jurisdiction. You're going to his court expecting him to correct the problem. He created the problem. He's the criminal! You don't take your case to the criminal, you take your criminal to court. When the government of South Africa began to trample upon the human rights of the people of South Africa they were taken to the U.N. When the government of Portugal began to trample upon the rights of our brothers and sisters in Angola, it was taken before the U.N. Why, even the white man took the Hungarian question to the U.N. And just this week, Chief Justice Goldberg was crying over three million Jews in Russia, about their human rights â€“ charging Russia with violating the U.N. Charter because of its mistreatment of the human rights of Jews in Russia. Now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight? Now you tell me why the leaders of this struggle have never taken So our next move is to take the entire civil rights struggle â€“ problem â€“ into the United Nations and let the world see that Uncle Sam is guilty of violating the human rights of 22 million Afro-Americans right down to the year of 1964 and still "

Liar's Nightmare,"I have always been here And I'll always be there I can honestly tell you That I really don't care If all the babies are broken And the old folks are blind There's a hole in my heart But I know you don't mind If I laugh at the cripples And I cry for the clowns And I welcome the madness That I see coming down And I have no opinions So I feel no remorse I can see the Black Knight Riding up on his horse And there's fire in his nostrils And blood in his eyes And he's looking at you, kid As he races on by So watch out for his hooves They're gonna kill you for sure He's got some kind of sickness That no man can cure And his breath it will burn you And put out your eyes He'll tear out your tongues So you can't even cry That your body is broken And your spirit is dead And you hope against hope That it's a bad dream you had About a meeting with Elvis At the back of the store You're both shoveling plasticware Right out of the door And the men who control you Keep yelling for more, more, more, more You pay all your taxes But you don't know what for 'Cause nothing seems to get better Things seem to get worse We're all living in danger From a politician's curse All promises have been broken All lips have been read Well the mouth has spoken But nothing's been said The dream has been shattered The flags have been burned You better make up your minds From whatever you've learned About your family values And the way they've been scorned Some babies have been battered Way before they've been born Some call me a liar Some call me a thief But the way that I look at things I can't get no relief So I went to a meeting Spoke out of fear They said, ""Thank you for sharing Now why are you here?"" I said: everything's shaking Including myself I keep all my feelings High up on a shelf And I can't seem to reach them But I know they were there I'm trapped in this vacuum And I'm gasping for air Some people get better Some people just fold Some people rise above it Or so I've been told So I started to leave I was searching for more They caught ahold of my sleeve But I slipped through the door I ran back to the office With my back to the wall When I came to my senses I had no one to call So I called up the doctor He told me to lie He said, ""Get out of this nightmare Or you surely will die? So I forced myself to wake up And opened my eyes But the man in the mirror Was there in disguise He was playing his part Living in a trance Sentenced to be a witness 'Cause he had no defense The anesthetic is wearing thin And you're starting to sweat And you finally realize That it ain't over yet 'Cause the way you've been feeling They must have hit a nerve I know it's not what you want But it's what you deserve The operation is over Listen to me please I'm begging forgiveness Down on my knees Coming back to consciousness I was out of my head Well the dream is over And I'm back in my bed I've always been here And I'll always be there I can honestly tell you That I really do care I gotta tell you the truth About the sadness I find I have opened my heart to you And I hope you don't mind"

Whoo! Less than five minutes I'm barely picking up my pen, he slams his down like, ""I'M FINISHED"" And the tats on your neck and your back and chest Are all handsome and fresh and demand my respect The lines are so subtle with casual depth That I find that each ones more bad ass than the next You're on some super duper action hero movie shit That NO OTHER human does I can't tell if it's skilled training or it's just stupid luck But a fight on top of a train Hit the tunnel and you would duck Then roll off at the next overpass and land on a moving truck See, one time, I got him a hooker just to show how much I like the guy Cause I figured he'd light her tail up just like she was a firefly But instead of fucking banging her He's such a nice a fucking guy That I found her later and he was fucking-had her on his knee and he was giving her life advice I mean, you miss a party that Pat throws your fucking life's over He's got candy mountains, chocolate fountains, ice sculptures Whether you drink or your life's sober Fucking people swarm like vultures But the kids are the real winners because he promotes the right culture Check me, check me, check me Each course tastes more great when you're dining at your place From the way that the fork's placed Each setting so ornate If you're taking his bar exam it isn't a court date Fuck a bottle of Bordeaux, he's gonna uncork crates Waiters with shorn traits keep bringing out more plates From the cheese and acorn grate To dessert, a sorbet, from the Chiffon cakes To delightfully warm crapes He was even feeding me oysters like shit was his foreplay From the way that the pork sprays to the way that the Corn Flakes Encrusted the port steak, motherfucker is GOURMET!

Hahahaha I'm not done complimenting him I got more compliments I said he uses his battles and his mackerels for showing off his big genitalia But he always hides his music, the fucking slick little sailor Y'all should listen, it makes it seem that Biggie's a failure You make Mozart look like Iggy Izalea I said you always hide that shit You should shout it from the roof tops Your tunes pop my jukebox You're the 2Pac of the Boondox You're the reason for my crusty tube sock And a hair doll in my shoe box You're so smooth that Neil Armstrong is jealous of your moon walk Yo, check me Here's a thing or two just to show how much I think of you I learn how to wink just so I could wink at you The way I feel about him man...it's all an obsession He could've killed me but instead he put me on in a session I don't even know how to fucking talk to this legend So, just to show my gratitude I GOT YOU A PRESENT! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! {Pay Stay opens the present and takes out a pink sweater} Most people would say I would kick his ass You're probably right But I would never raise my right hand to a man with the body of Christ However I would nail you... ...to a cross you fucking fags! As I fan you with a leaf and slowly feed your chocolate covered grapes But if you did have something to say you'd get punched in the face I'll come right to your crib... Speaking of which, I like what you've done with the place Hard wood floors, new paint, two shades, blue/grey Perfectly matches the duvet So nice I damn near left my girl and asked him if he needed a roommate Heart shapes love seats with a chic suede couch To hangout and just cuddle on as you lay down in Shay's Lounge Potpourri with chestnuts and acorns in the glass; wow The decor, you must've been watching gay porn in the background That's a compliment! Aye, aye wait Bed is made everyday in that special way you do {claps hands} Boom, the setting changes to an entertainment room You electrician! Interior decorator now you're a fucking tradesman too?

Just stuttered and you asked me what I said but I didn't want to repeat it though You said, ""Nah I didn't hear you, what did you say?"" I said, ""Ah, I said I just thought that I'd seen a ghost."" But what I actually said was ""I wish you and me could reenact the pottery scene from Ghost!"" But I'm not gonna sit here and dwell on what could've been what I'm just saying those two dudes in that Macklemore video should've been us Aye With your Greek god, sweet bod No pun intended but I bet your bird's so pretty they called it a fucking peacock Look, I'm not gay but... C'mon You know?

Hey! Heard you were top of your class in track and field That shit's real Explains your delicious 8 pack of vacuum sealed tight abs of steel I was outside your hotel door while you were fucking your girl to see how loud she squeals Wait until she came out then cornered her against the wall like...""How'd it feel?""

She said it was great You little man whore Man, I bet you got so much rhythm you just fuck like you're on the dance floor I couldn't keep up with him, that's for damn sure A couple leg strokes and my leg's sore You could probably fuck my bitch to that old techno song ""Sandstorm"" On fast forward! He's got an enormous horse dick It's hard to play sports with cause none of his shorts fit It has to be picked up with a forklift Runs up to kick a field goal and slips on his fucking foreskin Gets a boner and has to pop the highest dosage of ibuprofen I would know this Hold on, hold on, that's time. You cut man. You're cut Nah, nah. Let him finish!

You must've just washed this It smells awesome I LOVE YOU! Time Yo, so there has been some ah, questionable shit in this battle But it's cool cause we know Pat is straight, eh? Plus, back in school, little Patrick got straight A's From K until grade 8 Which I think is the same age he lost his virginity fucking a Playmate And the way he fucks? He wants to talk about my sex THE WAY HE FUCKS! Like a god from a porn movie In fact, I heard you got accused of banging one of Thor's groupies Can we talk about his hair? Why, could he age more smoothly? Those subtle grays look fucking great like a young George Clooney I seriously, I seriously bet you have the hottest sex I'm dry hump and repeat Shit's mind numbingly weak His shit's 500 degrees And I can't believe you molested Charron, you sly son of a B A million questions popped into my mind like...""Why wasn't it me?"" I mean, I mean, first Sandusky wouldn't touch me Then Pat never felt the D The fact that no one will molest me is really killing my self esteem I mean, I SERIOUSLY CAN'T BELIEVE that you molested Charron After all the days and nights I spent texting your phone All the pictures, all the meme's with the X's and O's And my face photoshopped on Sylvester Stallone But still But still...I gotta say that I admire you dude To the point that I'd never want to see you mired in gloom In fact, I would do anything to brighten your mood Just to see you smile CAUSE IT LIGHTS UP A ROOM! Fucking, giant, lion sized dude with a giant IQ You were inspired by Shuffle and Marlo You know who I'm inspired by? You Oh fucking iron size man, I'll fucking idolize you I watch from a distance and I hired private eyes too When I heard that Pat Stay was your best friend Err-I heard Hollohan was your best friend I got actually pissed Infuriated, I didn't know that type of madness exists So now I watch you when you hang with other people alone And when you go off to use the bathroom I come and sneak through your phone cause you're perfect Pat I seriously just think you're sent from above My therapist calls it crazy but I just think that it's fucking love! Pat, what I feel about you Hold up, off the top of my mind Well, you're more polished and more honest and more awesome than I I can see you talking politics, rocking a tie All that tough guy shit, I bet it's all a disguise I felt trauma cause I was ostracized for all of my life by the popular guys But your positive vibe Your positive vibe Whoopsies...I just forgot all my lines for a second right there cause I was LOST IN YOUR EYES! WHAT?! WHAT? WHAT?! Whenever Pat Stay's with me, nothing compares When he leaves it's, ""Pat stay with me"" I'm stuck in despair The hot color this season? Any color you wear I want you to Patrick Swayze, Dirty Dancing hold me up in the air! The way I feel about you Man, it's all an obsession I seriously can't even believe you put me on in a session I seriously can't even believe I get to talk to this legend So just to show my gratitude I GOT YOU A PRESENT! Let's go! It's a nice watch! It's a nice watch! What?! We got another present! It's a very nice, it's a very nice watch You said I age smoothly, look who's talking bud This is an all ages event You can fuck any girl here at the waterfront Young George Clooney, psst Fed the same damn fade since grade 11 So I don't appreciate you showing up here like goddamn David Beckham What, you think just because I'm big I got no feelings? So much shit you guys don't deal with, low ceilings And since I'm tall when I go to shows I have to stand behind y'all Cause if not, I get fucking yelled at cause you can't see like it's my fault What? That's funny? Huh? That makes you laugh huh? You know how awkward I look in a fucking bath tub? Try to go tan and can't fit in the booth you stand in So I have to crouch down all creepy looking like a fucking praying mantis I hate being so big and huge Can't fit in fitting rooms Tag a girl with some little dude and he's got a bigger dick than you So much pressure and expectation we have to live up to The things you do we get ridiculed for it limits you! Like for example I happen to think that Boston Terriers are pretty cute But if I get caught walking down the street with one I'm gonna look like a fricking goof Maybe I'm not a pitbull dude Maybe I have feelings too Maybe one damn time in my life I'd like to be the little spoon Get off of me! You know how bad I've wanted to play beer pong? But being so big and all these tattoos, I don't know it just feels wrong I used to see you guys playing at parties and make fun of you Acting all rough and tough But as I watch out the corner of my eye I think, ""Man this game looks fun as fuck"" Beach volleyball, YEP, shit looks fucking dope Get a tan as you dive and just land in the sand, have I ever done it? Nope Too gangsta for that Too lanky for that You're the perfect size and you're circumcised You should be thankful for that Buddy bag! That's it. Everyone have a good one or what? And the winner is...both of them"
Intro - Live,"When the dream came I held my breath with my eyes closed I went insane Like a smoke ring day When the wind blows Now I won't be back till later on If I do come back at all But you know me, and I miss you now In a strange game I saw myself as you knew me When the change came And you had a chance to see through me Though the other side is just the same You can tell my dream is real Because I love you, can you see me now Though we rush ahead to save our time We are only what we feel And I love you, can you feel it now"
Outro,"(Neil Young) There's colors on the street, red, white and blue People shufflin' their feet, people sleepin' in their shoes But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead Don't feel like Satan but I'm to them So I try to forget it anyway I can Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand Under an old street light near a garbage can Now, she's put the kid away and she's gone to get a hit She hates her life and what she's done to it That's one more kid that'll never go to school Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world We got a thousand points of light for the homeless man We got a kindler, gentler, machine gun hand We've got department stores and toilet paper Got styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer Got a man of the people says keep hope alive Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world"

Distant Camera,"The flash of a distant camera Reconnecting thoughts and actions Fragments of our missing dreams Pieces from here and there Fall in place along the line Disappearing between you and me Life is changing everywhere I go New things and old both disappear If life is a photograph fading in the mirror All I want is a song of love Song of love to sing for you All I need is this song of love To sing for you On the floor where daylight dances With the ones that missed their chances When they couldn't let it show Lies the land of sweet surrender Like a dream, it might have ended there But we didn't even know Now forever we will live as one Floating in love's atmosphere If love is a piece of dust shining in the sun All I want is a song of love Song of love to sing for you All I need is this song of love To sing for you Song of love Song of love"

Horseshoe Man,"In the land of the broken hearted People lookin' for the horseshoe man They've been pickin' up little pieces They've been puttin' them all in his hand In the way the story started Two lovers long ago Took a vow to live with heartbreak Took a chance but how could they know Love How could they know love? Love How could they know love? Horseshoe man's been workin' his magic Fixing heartbreak everywhere He's the one we all can count on When we're lost and don't know where love is He takes the pieces in his hands And shakes 'em up like he doesn't care He says that there will always be heartbreak Because love is everywhere Love I don't know about love?

Red Sun,"When the red sun sets on the railroad town And the bars begin to laugh with a happy sound I'll still be here right by your side There'll not be anyone in my heart but you And the dreams that you're having, they won't let you down If you just follow on 'cause you know where you're bound The well will be flowing and the words will come fast When the one who is coming arrives here at last On the grassy hills of the railroad town Where we cut through the fences and over the crown Where wind was blowing right through your hair I dreamt that my Momma and Daddy were there And the dreams that you're having, they won't let you down If you just follow on 'cause you know where you're bound The well will be flowing and the words will come fast When the one who is coming arrives here at last When the red sun sets on the railroad town And the bars begin to laugh with a happy sound I'll still be here right by your side There'll not be another in my heart but you"

The Great Divide,"In the canyons of the great divide Familiar places that we can run and hide Are filled with strangers walking in our houses alone In the great divide, nothing to decide No one else to care for or love In the great divide you won't fit in too well On the horses of the carousel She rides alone with you and me She rides like she knows wherever she goes, we'll be there On the carousel life is going well Anyone can tell, we're in love On the carousel, you're gonna like the way you feel You and I, we got caught down there In the twisted canyons of the great divide We walked the floor, now we don't go there anymore In the great divide, nothing to decide No one else to care for or love In the great divide I don't fit in too well In the great divide, nothing to decide No one else to care for or love In the great divide you won't fit in too well"
Amelia,"I was driving across the burning desert When I spotted six jet planes Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain It was the hexagram of the heavens It was the strings of my guitar Amelia, it was just a false alarm The drone of flying engines Is a song so wild and blue It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you And then your life becomes a travelogue Of picture postcard charms Amelia, it was just a false alarm Now people will tell you where they've gone They'll tell you where to go But till you get there yourself you will never really know Where some have found their paradise Others just come to harm Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm I wish that she was here tonight It's so hard to obey Her sad request of me to kindly stay away So this is how I hide the hurt As the road leads cursed and charmed I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm A ghost of aviation She was swallowed by the sky Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly Like Icarus ascending On beautiful foolish arms Amelia, it was just a false alarm Now maybe I've never really loved I guess that is the truth I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude And looking down on everything I crashed into her arms Amelia, it was just a false alarm I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel To shower off the dust And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust I dreamed of 747s Over geometric farms Dreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms"
Before Tomorrow Falls on Love,Where's that brave new world We used to talk about and smile Eyes filled with candlelight Clothes piled on the floor Blue smoke and the scent of sex An untidy sort of love To strike out against all the bitterness A wall against the ugliness A cure for all this loneliness Music to balance cold dark math Before tomorrow falls on love That brilliant fleeting light Was just within our grasp Before the weight of love Could ever come to mind Someone with whom to share a little tenderness In that careless place and time Of love without promises to keep Without a future or remnants of the past Before the toll that time will take Before the blinding light is cast Before tomorrow falls on love
Capitol,"It's built to impress you and it works like that All that white marble and the guards at the door The metal detector, the following eyes Geometric patterns covering the floor The symbols of power, eagles and flags Attendants, assistants moving like sharks Through crowds of citizens, patriotic souls Visiting the capitol and National Parks And you think to yourself This is where it happens They run the whole damned thing from here Money to burn Filling up their pockets Where no one can see And no one can hear I wonder what they say, say to each other How do they think, what do they feel When they come out of those rooms And put on their faces Is anything they say to the cameras real? They come for the power for power they stay And they'll do anything to keep it that way They'll ignore the constitution And hide behind the scenes Anything to stay a part of the machine And you think to yourself This is where it happens They run the whole damned thing from here Money to burn Filling up their pockets Where no one can see And no one can hear And the votes are just pieces of paper And they sneer at the people who voted And they laugh as the votes were not counted And the will of the people was noted And completely ignored And you think to yourself This is where it happens They run the whole damned thing from here Money to burn Filling up their pockets Where no one can see And no one can hear"
Curved Air,"Flashes and curved air I can't trust my eyes The things that Iâ€™m seeing Look like lies The wind has shoulders Pushing me aside The sky is a cavern open wide I thought I was leaving I got no time for that It's too strange here to be serious Too rocky to be flat Too serious to be calm So moderate and white I heard, ""inside the fence, you're alright"" If I could get some traction here A little solid ground A piece of working action here I might get found Might get found I remember silence The moment that I knew All the air turning solid Curved and blue Throwing us across the road Into that rigid wall I woke up in the dark Across the hall If I could get some traction here A little solid ground A piece of working action here I might get found Might get found"
Here It's Almost Sunset,Here it's almost sunset so Why is the sun shining brighter How can that be How can I still see Everything all around me Darker and lighter Stumbling down this avenue Thought I call you and try to describe These treasures I found Just lying around And I'm crying out loud here To reach the rest of my tribe A player is speaking to me His brain running out of the ends of his fingers He is speaking in tongues His feeling just runs Right up my side of the street And a hint of it lingers This is probably all my fault This is the life I chose For better or for worse I picked this verse As one where finally I tell where the truth rose And my truth is just this The music snuck in and it's playing me The keys and the strings Are all wonderful things Taking a hold of and then Setting me free
Home Free,"I would sometimes when it rained put a candle there As if it were an alter all white and bare And I'd draw myself a bath and soak in the dark As if I were Noah and this was my ark And Iâ€™d look out of that window at the towering sky And think to myself, ""How lucky am I"" That I have my home and I live here Like a baby in a blanket with nothing to fear I'd boil up some coffee on that battered old stove And wonder how those people could travel and rove So wild and unprotected out across this great land Out in the wind, out in the sand And I think I'll never leave here, never leave here at all Like a tree always knowing where itâ€™s leaves will fall You fight like the devil to hold this ground This place of safety that we've found These roots reach out past the shadow of the tree We thought we could be home free Now I will sometimes put some flowers outside As if they were a picket fence to help me hide And I'll bury this talisman beneath the great tree We'll stay here together my old friend and me And I'll look out of that window at the towering sky And I'll think to myself, ""How lucky am I"" That I have my home and I live here Like a baby in a blanket with nothing to fear"
Sell Me a Diamond,"He wanted to sell me a diamond He said it was conflict free Was such a beautiful concept That such a thing could be See it shining on the velvet Faceted fire lying there While I listen to a couple arguing Three feet behind my chair Bitterness soaks their voices It's been riding them for years Anger they keep on carrying Old hurt words in their ears Sell me a diamond, I have to know If this transaction is the key to letting go Empty my pockets, you'll find a ring Is there a crime if no one loses anything Sell me a diamond, one fluid moment And seven crows above could be an omen Sell me a diamond I'll just stop watching news I guess You know that would be a gift Just listen to children laughing And give myself a lift And maybe I'll see somebody Kind to someone in the street And I will give this gift to The next diamond soul I meet Sell me a diamond, one fluid moment You know seven crows above could be an omen Empty my pockets, you'll find a ring Is there a crime if no one loses anything Sell me a diamond, I have to know If this transaction is the key to letting go Sell me a diamond Makes conflict free sound good to me Makes conflict free sound good to me Makes conflict free sound good to me Makes conflict free sound good to me"
She's Got To Be Somewhere,Like a frozen angel That's fallen down from too high Her wings begin to open Just before she runs out of sky Pack up the El Dorado Thereâ€™s plenty of fire for the task at hand A thousand suns pray to a tower Too many secrets buried in the sand She's got to be somewhere soon The book never lies Across the Santa Ana to the land of blue skies She's on a mission with a graphic twist Sheâ€™s got to be somewhere She's got to be somewhere soon Never should have tried to run her Now someone has a case of a second smile And the only sign of trouble Is drippin' from a turnstile (At the dam) Hard as a desert flower Leaning into the devil wind The seeds might be forgotten They just might scatter with her sins She's got to be somewhere soon The book never lies Across the Santa Ana to the land of blue skies She's on a mission with a graphic twist She's got to be somewhere She's got to be somewhere soon She's got to be somewhere soon The book never lies Across the Santa Ana to the land of blue skies Sheâ€™s on a mission with a graphic twist Sheâ€™s got to be She's got to be Sheâ€™s got to be She's got to be
Sky Trails,"The dream fades And I'm lying awake Before I open my eyes, tryin' to picture where I'll be Uncharted sea Am I close to the breakers? It's time to get out bed But my heart won't follow me It's funny I don't even know what city I am in - Or what time it is where I am or where you are My only constancy is you're the one Who feels like home to me So why was I so careless with your heart? Before I brave the hall I try to write you a letter And watch the cursor keep time until I have to go As I rush out I glance in the mirror To find a creature waiting to climb to the light Where she belongs Like scorpions in amber Or the sparks above the campfire Dances underneath a rare blood moon Spinning there and barefoot Shadowed by the blazes cast And dancing out their hearts into the sky Sky trails The sky fails To tell me where I am Please tell me where I am Tell me"
Somebody Home,"I know what you think about Guys like me Looking at you hungry Loving what they see And only seeing the surface And not what's beneath We're thinking about winning ya Like winning a race And missing you and watching them And being stunned by your face But when I look at your face I think there's somebody home I wonder what your thinking Wonder what you see Wonder why you're looking At a man like me But when I think about calling you Think there's somebody home I've seen you walking I've heard you speak Heard you at a whisper Seen you weak But when you sing to me There's somebody home One of these days I'll Get my courage up Sit down at your table Pour some coffee in my cup And I will tell you I love you, yes I will 'Cause there's somebody home"
Be Yourself,How does it feel When life doesn't seem real And you're floating about on your own Your life is uncertain So you draw the curtain Pretending there's nobody home But don't theorize Look in your eyes They can't tell lies Though you disguise what you see The mirror is free But we once had a savior But by our behavior The one that was worth it is gone Songbirds are talking And the runners are walking A prodigal son is coming home And don't theorize Look in his eyes They won't tell lies But if he defies what you see He'll give you the key Be yourself Be yourself Be yourself Be yourself We needed a tutor So built a computer And we programmed ourselves not to see The truth and the lying The dead and the dying A silent majority But don't theorize Look in their eyes Are they telling lies The ones that they learned on TV What a way to be free Be yourself Be yourself Free yourself Free yourself See yourself See yourself Then you can free yourself Be yourself Be yourself
Better Days,"When your love has moved away You must face yourself and you must say I remember better days Don't you cry 'cause she is gone She is only moving on Chasing mirrors through a haze Now that you know it's nowhere What's to stop you coming home? All you got to do is go there Then you'll really realize what's going down You went to a strange land searching For a truth you felt was wrong That's when the heartaches started Though you're where you want to be, you're not where you belong When your love has moved away You must face yourself and you must say I remember better days Don't you cry 'cause she is gone She is only moving on Chasing mirrors through a haze"

Man in the Mirror,"On the end of a tightrope I'm over the town I'd be good in a circus But so would a clown From the way that I feel All my hang-ups are down In the middle of nowhere I found me a tree And the fruit that we live on Reminds me of me Though we live in the air I'm not sure that we're free And I don't really have much to say 'Cause I'm living from day to day, somewhere And I don't care what the people say 'Cause if everyone knows the way, we're nowhere Two and two make four They never make five And as long as we know it We all can survive Make sure that the things you do Keep us alive And I don't really have much to say 'Cause I'm living from day to day, somewhere And I don't care what the people say 'Cause if everyone knows the way, we're nowhere Is the image I'm making The image I see When the man in the mirror Is talking to me"

Sleep Song,"When you were asleep I was kissing your forehead You gave a frown, so I kissed you again You started waking and put your arms around my waist Just making sure I was there Then you drifted away Then you drifted away And when I awoke I found out I'd been dreaming Some of my bedclothes were still on the floor I looked around, realized you were leaving me I saw the back of your dress As you slipped through the door As you slipped through the door *Vocalizations* And when I return I will kiss your eyes open Take off my clothes, and I'll lie by your side And then I will wait till the sandman has done with you And as you sleepily rise You'll find I'll be there You'll find I'll be there"
There's Only One,"We can heed the call We can trip and fall We can read the scrawl On the garden wall Let the ashes fall Upon us all Or not at all It's in us all Can we say it's cool From a heated pool When we give a jewel To a starving fool And if we can't be cruel Then let us take the tool And change the rule, change the rule When we've all begun To see the world we're on Don't you see there's only one Then we all begin To see the skin we're in It's just the same There's only one There's only one Do we have the grace To begin the race In another place Face to face Do we stand the pace Or do we let the case Go to waste, go to waste, go to waste Do you like the taste"

Open Secret,"Does everyone have their dark side Like the backside of a lover's moon Do we cry out for justice at sunrise To be cleansed by confessions at noon Have Mercy Still my heart is an open secret Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed Just as we seem to end the one act play We draw so much farther apart Each new opening, a different time for closing Will I sing my last symphony to an empty room? Still my heart is an open secret Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed Most of my life has gone up and down And I don't see no reason for all this pain Who was it said, ""Life is too short"" All this hurtin' just makes it seem a shame Still my heart is an open secret Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed"

All Those Dreams,"When the morning comes and youâ€™re still sleepin' With all those dreams in your pretty head I light a fire while the sun comes creepin' All across the meadow bed The old clock has stopped, no longer ticking No longer counting every second Out by the car our snowman's melting Nothin' can bring him back now His smile a twig and his nose a cucumber His eyes two pine cones looking out We got pictures of him like two little kids laughin' In the snow we were walking hand in hand We went lookin' for a big surprise And when we found before our eyes Two white elks grazing on the green We heard the honkers comin' Landing on the lakes of summer Nesting there and waiting for a dream When the morning comes and youâ€™re still sleepin' With all those dreams in your pretty head I light a fire and the sun comes creepin' All across the meadow bed"
Glimmer,"When Iâ€™m riding down the road in my car travelin' without you I can still see you sittinâ€™ there, right by my side With the headlights of the oncoming cars flashin' in the windshield Thereâ€™s a glimmer of everything that I once saw in you Tough love can leave you almost alone But new love brings back everything to you All the feelings in your heart come re-awakened Like a forest without leaves on itâ€™s trees standing in the desert Like the light that still leaks through when you close the door Like the changes in our life that hits so hard that day I couldnâ€™t find you Thereâ€™s a glimmer of everything good that once came before Tough love can leave you almost alone But new love brings back everything to you All the feelings in your heart come reawakened And thereâ€™s a glimmer of everything good that once came before Thereâ€™s still a glimmer of everything that I first saw in you"

Plastic Flowers,"In the summertime we met to see a threat That came to harm something we both loved And as the hours passed we talked until at last It came the time to part I was doing well and I thought she liked my style I had no business thinking like that but it lasted quite a while I got my promises made but before the timeless father I showed plastic flowers to Mother Natureâ€™s daughter She held a vase, her misty gaze brought them to life I was amazed, she turned to me with a tear in her eye We went to give our thanks along the river banks And watched the water flow as it rolled along She scooped some river sand and held it in her hand And sang a little song We saw the water lines left there from ancient times I watched the sand falling through her fingers On the shore so dry I was doing well, and I thought she liked my style I had no business feeling like that but it lasted quite a while I got my promises made but before the timeless father I showed plastic flowers to Mother Natureâ€™s daughter"
Say Hello to Chicago,"When the blues moved north to Chicago they came And I caught some myself in this blind alley and rain Close to the L with its clattering train Near an old ornate theater where I soon will be playing I soon will be playing So I said hello for you, when I saw a stylish girl Walking by on the sidewalk with her hair in a swirl From the wind that was growing at the end of the day And I wondered what would be coming my way What would be coming my way Coming my way You know I been to Chicago, I was here once before And the rain kept on pounding outside the stage door I was singing and drinking with love in my heart I was younger and stronger while life played itâ€™s part While life played itâ€™s part Life played itâ€™s part Life played itâ€™s part Let us not be strangers if we come to know Things about each other that seem to come and go â€˜Cause friendship is everything if love is to last And I have my guard down and love passes fast Love passes fast Love passes fast Love passes fast Say hello to Chicago Say hello to Chicago Say hello to Chicago Say hello to Chicago"
Tumbleweed,"Tumbleweed Your inner spirit is a peace sign to me Life is full of little tricks and We can always pick up sticks and build again Thatâ€™s what we do Harmony The way we hold on when we tumble through the night Life is full of strange delights and In the darkness we find lights to make our way Back home again Tumbleweed Iâ€™m baring my soul to you Tumbleweed Itâ€™s all that Iâ€™ve got thatâ€™s true Bite me now With your confusion, your happiness and delight It will only hurt a moment Then itâ€™s gone and you can see thereâ€™s nothing left To leave a mark Animal Care for your kind, in the way you always do When the flower moon is shining Itâ€™s eclipse and your lips smiling comfort me And I comfort you Tumbleweed Your inner spirit is a peace sign to me"
Broken Arrow - Live - Canterbury House 1968,"The lights turned on and the curtain fell down And when it was over, it felt like a dream They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream The agents had paid for the black limousine That waited outside in the rain Did you see them? Did you see them? Did you see them in the river? They were there to wave to you Could you tell that the empty-quivered Brown-skinned Indian on the banks That were crowded and narrow Held a broken arrow? Eighteen years of American dream He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall His mother had told him a trip was a fall And don't mention babies at all Did you see him? Did you see him? Did you see him in the river? He was there to wave to you Could you tell that the empty-quivered Brown-skinned Indian on the banks That were crowded and narrow Held a broken arrow? The streets were lined for the wedding parade The queen wore the white gloves, the county of song The black-covered caisson her horses had drawn Protected her king from the sun rays of dawn They married for peace and were gone Did you see them? Did you see them? Did you see them in the river? They were there to wave to you Could you tell that the empty-quivered Brown-skinned Indian on the banks That were crowded and narrow Held a broken arrow?"
Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing - Live - Canterbury House 1968,"Hey, who's that stomping all over my face? Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace? Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung? Taking my gypsy before she's begun? To sing in the meaning of what's in my mind Before I can take home what's rightfully mine Joining and a-listening and talking in rhymes Stopping the feeling to wait for the time Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing? 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing Who's all hung up on that happiness thing? Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings? And who's in the corner and down on the floor? With pencil and paper just counting the score Who's trying to act like he's just in-between? The night isn't black if you know that it's green But don't bother looking, you're too blind to see Who's coming on like he wanted to be? And who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing? 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing And who's coming home on old ninety-five? Who's got the feeling to keep him alive? Though having it and sharing it ain't quite the same It ain't a gold nugget, you can't lay a claim Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor? There it is, baby, don't you worry no more Who should be sleeping, but is writing this song? Wishing and a-hoping he weren't so damned wrong Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing? 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing? Nowadays Clancy can't even sing"
Out of My Mind - Live - Canterbury House 1968,"Out of my mind And I just can't take it anymore Left behind By myself and what I'm living for All I hear are screams from outside the limousines That are taking me Out of my mind Through the keyhole in an open door Happy to find That I don't know what I'm smiling for Tired of hanging on If you've miss me, I've just gone 'Cause they're taking me Out of my mind"

Another Broken Heart,"Day after day I see you slipping into darkness and I wanna know Are you okay Or are you looking for another place that you can go For good advice Or just a friendly face that you can pour your heart out to And pay the price To find the difference between something old and something new And when I sing my song Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry Cuts you deep and tears you apart And will you let love try? No, you say you're not that strong And you don't need another broken heart No, you don't need another broken heart Night after night I feel the dawning of a morning coming around the bend Are you alright Or are you feeling that your future's coming to an end? Keep hanging on The life you're leading's taking you to places never known You could be wrong Maybe your soul is pleading for a chance to be alone And when I sing my song Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry Cuts you deep and tears you apart And will you let love try? No, you say you're not that strong And you don't need another broken heart No, you don't need another broken heart Broken heart Do you want another love affair to start?

Back Home,"Look inside, and you will find you Take your time, 'cause time will take you From your sky, the sun is falling But Mother Earth will soon be calling you Back home Dust to dust, ashes to ashes At the speed of light, time slowly passes And at the end, I guess nothing matters You lived your life before the wind Scattered you back home As the curtain is falling And you sing your last song May the circle be unbroken As the band plays on and on Take a load off Lay your burden down Ah Ah As the curtain is falling And you sing your last song May the circle be unbroken As the band plays on Take a load off Take a load off Lay your burden down Lay your burden down From your eyes, the light is fading And no one knows what will be waiting So take a breath and take another And your soul will fly across the border Taking you back home"
Beneath the Waves,"Here in the same boat With danger from the falling sails Trying to keep ourselves afloat By laughing at the howling gales Standing in the same shoes Frightened by the same fears How much more are you going to lose? How much pain for how many tears? Fifty years before the mast How long will it last Before sinking Beneath the waves Beneath the waves Sharing the same space Breathing in the same air Thinking all the same thoughts How to help and why to care Living in the same world A world that's full of love and lies A world that really doesn't care If we live or if we die Oh Fifty years before the mast How long will it last Before sinking Beneath the waves Beneath the waves Beneath the waves Rolling over read the weight of the water in my ears Holding my breath, it's causing me pain for so many years So many years Beneath the waves Beneath the waves Beneath the waves Yeah, yeah Ah Ah Ah"
Cracks in the City,Through the cracks in the city I can see the sad traces Of yesterday's empires With tomorrow's bad dreams They'll come back to haunt us Like the gaze in a mirror Reflecting the stakes that we took to extremes Oh The cracks in the city Will trap us and trip us Making us fall to the ground that we love And through the cracks in the city I can hear voices calling Taking us all from below to above To above So I will follow this path That my life lays before me That yesterday's hero Never dared to dream About the stories and tales All the long hidden memories That sound like the echoes Of a tale told between Oh Between the cracks in the city Will trap us and trip us Making us fall to the ground that we love And through the cracks in the city I can hear voices calling Taking us all from below to above To above The search for oblivion Starts out in the daylight Listening to people All trying to be first But dreaming in darkness Will offer no solace When all the king's horses Are dying of thirst Oh The cracks in the city That will trap us and trip us Making us fall to the ground that we love And through the cracks in the city I can hear voices calling Taking us all from below to above To above
Encore,"Whatcha gonna do When the last show is over? And whatcha gonna do When you can't touch base? And whatcha gonna do When the applause is all over And you can't turn your back On what you face? And who you gonna be When the lights are all fading? And who you gonna be When the band comes off? And who you gonna be When your heart is still aching And you can't shrug it off With just a laugh? Encore, encore The last song is over More, more The crowd's on its feet Sure, sure Adulation is so pleasing Encore, encore And whatcha gonna say To the last person leaving? And whatcha gonna say When the light is turned off? Whatcha gonna do If you stop believing That you can't seem to find What might be lost? And how you gonna feel If friends follow fortune? How you gonna feel If the music dies? How you gonna live With a soul sadly sighing Into the wind that is our life? Encore, encore The last song is over More, more The crowd's on its feet Sure, sure Adulation is so pleasing Encore, encore"
Fire Down Below,"Dogs in the distance Howling and barking Breaking the silence between us And off in the night I can feel something coming That might overwhelm but relieve us Lying awake with my heart in my hand I'm feeling a fire down below me What will I do when the morning is here? Will I see what the world has to show me? Fire down below Fire down below Fire in the heaven above me All I can ask of Whoever you are All I can ask is you love me All of my senses go into this focus A pinpoint of light at the center Burning a hole in the man that I am I'm a seeker, a friend, and a lover Cause there's a fire down below Fire down below Fire in the heaven above me All I can ask of Whoever you are All I can ask is you love me There's a fire down below Fire down below Fire in the heaven above me All I can ask of Whoever you are All I can ask is you love me"
Golden Days,"I used to be in a band Made up of my friends We played across the land When music had no end And so beginning We sang with all our hearts And everything we had Everything we gave Came back to everyone In the olden days Songs with soul And words with so much hope For a brighter day Oh, I know That people hurt But they tried to find a way Through those broken days But nowadays it seems That we all need to care And follow all our dreams And answer all our prayers What happened to ""All You Need Is Love""? And time will always pass There goes another day So slowly yet so fast That you can lose your way To these golden days Songs with soul And words with so much hope For a brighter day Oh, I know That people hurt But they tried to find a better way To these golden days Olden days Broken days Golden days"
Mississippi Burning,"High on a hillside out of town My grave just cannot hold me Lying still beneath the stars I am cold and I am lonely Kill me quickly or kill me slow My friends are not here with me Lying over yonder in the soil And both were murdered with me Long and scorching summer days With Mississippi burning Black and white and white and black Their world will keep on turning Mississippi burning Clouds come tumbling down Truth be told it's turning And I'm turning in the ground Sail on, sail on Up this mighty river Lay my soul to rest God will deliver Mississippi burning Clouds come tumbling down Truth be told it's turning And I'm turning in the ground Many a good soul lost their life And we were just three of them Arm in arm we stood our ground For something to believe in Lynch the truth it will not die It just comes back to haunt us Tell the truth and do not lie Our memory must be ageless Sail on, sail on Up this mighty river Lay my soul to rest God will deliver Sail on, sail on Up this mighty river Lay my soul to rest God will deliver"
Myself at Last,"Light is slowly fading And the night comes on so fast I'm drowning in my dreams It's so hard to fight the past When all is said and done It's so hard to count the cost When I'm rolling down This lonesome road To lose myself at last And the day that breaks before me May never be surpassed And the question haunting me Is my future just my past? So I'm screaming at the universe Just enough to make her laugh And I'm rolling down This lonesome road To lose myself at last And with everything I've ever done Well, I've tried to be my best But everyone I've ever known Has been some kind of test When everything is said and done It's so hard to find what's lost I'm rolling down This lonesome road To lose myself at last My dreams are only memories But they've all gone by so fast I was drifting on an ocean blue Like a ship without a mast And then you came and rescued me And you saved my soul at last From rolling down This lonesome road To find myself at last I'm rolling down This lonesome road And I've found myself at last I've found myself at last"
Target,"I am an archer With my arrows and a bow And I'm taking aim upon your heart By now, I'm sure you know That the arc of my arrows cut Through air and space and light Aiming at your very soul My target tonight And I hope my aim is true And that you never feel a thing As my arrow flies to find you Bringing love's eternal sting And though we are connected by A sparkling silver light The distances between the clouds My target tonight Ooh My target tonight Ooh Ooh My target tonight Ooh When I turn my eye towards you My quiver feels so full The bow is taut And I'm feeling the pull My dream appears before me in The early morning light 'Cause there you are beside me My target tonight Ooh My target tonight Ooh Ooh My target tonight Ooh"
The Last Fall,"It all starts to happen with the sun going down When the light gently falls and fades away And the air hangs heavy with the scent of your soul As it's saying goodbye to the end of the day And it all begins with the kiss of a lifetime That's never been given and never will alone And is it God given mercy, this absence of touch? Should you love me at all, could I love you this much? And I'm hearing your heartbeat from the distance of memory And with half of my heart I respect your sad call You can be who you are in this time of your trouble This time that we're sharing before the last fall And as I sit here and wonder about the fate of my being And the weight of my seeing you so far away But I refuse to go under this part of my loneliness When all of this heartache is heading my way I'm seeing your soul through the eyes of eternity When all my resistance is fading away And from the depths of this hole I can't deal with your agony Hoping to help you in any way And I'm hearing your heartbeat from the distance of memory And with half of my heart I respect your sad call But you can be who you are in this time of your trouble This time that we're sharing before the last fall And from where I am standing what looks like adversity May be anxiety wrapped up in fear Of failing to recognize the heartbeat of someone Of someone who wants you and sees you so clear I can only tell you to follow your feelings And follow your heart to the end of the road And you may find out when you finally get there And open a window, a-close up the door And I'm hearing your heartbeat from the distance of memory And with half of my heart I respect your sad call You can be who you are in this time of your trouble This time that we're sharing before the last fall"
This Path Tonight,"Where are we going? Where are we going? In my waking days of wonder All my ways of wrong and right Without my dreams of clouds and thunder I wander down this path tonight All these dangers of destruction Fill my breath with life and light I drink it deep and think about us On this path tonight This path tonight Where will it lead me? Crumbling rock and stones on fire This path tonight You better believe it I'm stumbling to my heart's desire On this path tonight I try to question all the answers Try to answer all that's asked I try my best to be myself But wonder who's behind this mask I'll take care of all my problems Comfort in my soul's delight I may not know just where I'm going But I'm on this path This path tonight Where will it lead me? Crumbling rock and stones on fire This path tonight You better believe it I'm stumbling to my heart's desire On this path tonight What will I do with all these feelings? Will my heart behave tonight? This time is not like any other Will I flee, or will I fight? No one knows just how I'm dealing With this heart that's not for hire It's got me rocking, got me reeling And I feel like I'm on fire This path tonight Where will it lead me? Crumbling rock and stones on fire This path tonight You better believe it I'm stumbling to my heart's desire On this path tonight Where will it lead me? Crumbling rock and stones on fire This path tonight Well, you better believe it I'm stumbling to my heart's desire On this path tonight This path tonight On this path tonight Yeah Where are we going? Where are we going? Down this path tonight Down this path tonight Down this path tonight"

Can't Get No Booty,"Can't get no booty can't get no booty Can't get no booty can't get no booty I can't see it anyway Because I've always been such an easy prey Can't get no booty can't get no booty Try'n and try'n again No matter how hard I shake my tailfeather In your face All I can think of it's such a disgrace There's so much good man goin' to waste Maybe it's because of the clothes I wear maybe it's the Palmade on my hair Can't get no booty can't get no booty Is it the way I talk maybe it's the way I walk Is it the way I think maybe it's just the way I speak Can't get no booty can't get no booty Can't get no booty can't get no booty Having trouble seeing through your shades What you been reading 'bout me in the trades?

Not Fade Away,"When I get restless What can I do? When I need someone I think about you I got to move on Not fade away I'm only just growing a little each day I got to quit this running round Never gonna get rid of these blues I got to find somebody to love Slow me down, yeah Look out now Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around When I get older Mellow down Get myself settled on a patch of ground Taking it easy Live every day Me and the raven We make our way I got to quit this running round I'm never gettin rid of these blues I got to find somebody to Make me slow down, yeah Look out Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around Sit yourself down Take a look around"
Thoroughfare Gap,"Sometimes I consider my pace I'm reminded of a train gathering speed for the climb to the pass; In whose shadow it already lies A small metal dragon approaching the ever present ascending rise To the Seventh Mountain Reeling and snaking and leaping it seems That it wants to come loose from it's path cast in iron; But you can't slow down now As the Earth has presented a new crest to reach Without barely a rest from the last one Can you wonder what lies beyond? Though you've been there before And forget about the effort and the strain; Always ascending, each yard as a mile To the never ending pull of the steepening grade that's before you It's no matter. No distance. It's the ride A valley, a forest, a desert, a stream And an oversized bridge for the trickle beneath; You remember the torrent it turned to last Spring From the snow melting fast And the river it became in the summer Perhaps it is ruin from a fire that has scorched it So badly that nothing will grow without rain; To wash away the blackened soil Now useless until called upon again In a future as distant and far away as the next range of mountains Then take it as far as you see and beyond With eyes you don't use enough to gather up strength; As Thoroughfare Gap What awaits is whatever you see When you get there of even before; It's no matter. No distance. It's the ride"
Columbus,Better keep your distance from this whale Better keep your boat from going astray Find yourself a partner and treat them well Try to give them shelter night and day 'Cause here in the blue light Far away from the fireside Things can get twisted and crazy and crowded You can't even feel right So I dream of Columbus Every time the panic starts I dream of Columbus With your maps and your beautiful charts I dream of Columbus There's an ache in a traveling heart See how the cormorant swoops and dives Must be a thrill to go that deep Down to the basement of this life Down to where the mermaid gently sleeps Not like here in the blue light Far away from the fireside Where things get twisted and Haunted and crowded You can't even feel right So I dream of Columbus Every time the panic starts I dream of Columbus With your maps and your beautiful charts I dream of Columbus There's an ache in a traveling heart As the tide must ebb and flow I am dragged down under I wait the livelong day For an end to my hunger So I dream of Columbus Every time the panic starts I dream of Columbus With your maps and your beautiful charts I dream of Columbus There's an ache in a traveling heart
Coverage,The TV is talkin' to me It's positive identification But maybe I'm mistaken I talk to my radio I keep it tuned to the all night show I'd give my last dime for coverage But you will not cover me I got a penchant for the printed page I got a mention in the Monday news I was on my last leg When it came through I talk to my radio I keep it tuned to the all night show I'd give my last dime for coverage But you will not cover me No no no no Tune it in to the pale blue light Whispers to me through the night Better love Better lovers Cover cover cover cover Cover cover cover cover Coverage I would have made it sooner see But I got caught up in the dream traffic Blew the demographics I talk to my radio I keep it tuned to the all night show I'd give my last dime for coverage But you will not cover me No. You will not cover me No. You will not cover me
Helpless Heart,I'm sitting in here inside the Strangest place And time is racing by I've been way out here for a month or more Tonight I'm wondering why You try to understand the things That I feel Maybe this time I'll find a way to Explain it And there was a dream Deep inside my head It only seemed like it's breaking the thread That holds me to you Still you have never wanted to Change me But darlin' I know Though we're far apart The signal is strong This helpless heart will always Belong to you Only to you No one but you This power takes me from the place I belong To where only the strong get through You've got to Keep on believing or you'll lose your way It slips right out on you Though there are days the light can Flicker or fade Here in this place tonight a fire is burning 'Cause there was a dream Deep inside my head It only seemed like it's breaking the thread That holds me to you Still you have never wanted to Change me But believe me I know Though we're far apart The signal is strong This helpless heart will always Belong to you Always belong to you Only to you Only to you No one but you
Hero,"It was one of those great stories That you can't put down at night The hero knew what he had to do And he wasn't afraid to fight The villain goes to jail While the hero goes free I wish it were that simple for me And the reason that she loved him Was the reason I loved him too And he never wondered What was right or wrong He just knew, he just knew Shadow and shape Mix together at dawn But by the time you catch them Simplicity's gone So we sort through the pieces My friends and I Searching through the darkness To find the breaks in the sky And the reason that she loved him Was the reason I loved him too And he never wondered What was right or wrong He just knew, he just knew And we wonder, yes, we wonder How do you make sense of this When the hero kills the maiden With his kiss, with his kiss Well, it was one of those great stories That you can't put down at night The hero knew what he had to do And he wasn't afraid to fight The villain goes to jail While the hero goes free I wish it were that simple for me Were that simple for me"
Natalie,"First time I saw her She was still in school Chewin' on a pencil Playin' pool Stayin' up all night Full of dreams I've known her family Ever since we were small Gettin' in trouble Drivin' our folks up the wall Wastin' time Yeah....but we had fun She was gonna Ride her bike to China Sail away on a bottle top And as the years passed by One night I held her close to me That was the first time I Said I love you To Natalie Carousel was crowded So we talked for a while Natalie said, ""Baby You know I miss your smile... Whenever you go away From me."" You know that time starts tickin' When a love starts to fade I knew something was wrong but still I thought we had it made The first time I Said I love you To Natalie That was the first time I Said I love you To Natalie Now I look at her pictures And I talk to these walls Call out her name But She don't hear Me at all And she got wild and restless Tried everything She could take One night I tried to stop her But I was too late That was the last time I Said I love you To Natalie And that was the last time I Said I love you To Natalie That was the last time I Said I love you That was the last time I Said I love you That was the last time I Said I love you To Natalie"
Old Soldier,"Listen old soldier wherever you are The hills or the valleys come near or come far They say youth's a treasure we waste when we're young So come down from the place where your medals are hung You're forever returning and learning to fight And you feel just like an old soldier tonight Listen old soldier 'cause time doesn't wait The moon's on your shoulder, the hour is late There's something there inside you still calls out to you And you won't fade away whatever you do You're forever beginning barely winning the fight And you feel just like an old soldier tonight You're not getting any younger That much is true now But you still got that hunger Burning in you now So what do you do now? What do you do now? Listen old soldier to the sound in your ears Of too many battles for too many years There's only one thing you've learned in defeat Losing is bitter and victory is sweet You're always unraveling, traveling light And you feel just like an old soldier tonight Feel just like an old soldier tonight"
Thousand Roads,"I used to walk around with my eyes on fire My nerves real close to my skin Had a fist full of questions and a brand on my cheek And we would skate where the ice got thin And the smoke blowin' down from a cabin on a hilltop Smoke blowin' down in the street Some kind of sweet smellin' mystical backdrop To the story unfolding at my feet There's an edge to the twist of an acrobat in the air There's an edge to the twist of a knife There's a hard heart of darkness hovering there Just around the corner from life And I, I have no answers I got no patented path to set you free Besides I wouldn't know where you wanted to go And it's probably not the same place as me There's a thousand roads up this mountain You can get lost in a minute if you try And it's probably enough that I was just laughing today, yeah Lookin' this close in your eye I said there was a thousand roads up this mountain You can get lost in a minute if you try It's probably enough that I was just laughing today, yeah Looking this close in your eye, in your eye In your eye"
Through Your Hands,"You were dreaming on a park bench About a broad highway somewhere When the music from the carillon Seemed to hurl your heart out there Past the scientific darkness Past the fireflies that float To an angel bending down To wrap you in her warmest cloak And you ask ""What am I not doing?"" She says ""Your voice cannot command"" She says, ""In time you will move Mountains And it will come Through your hands."" Still you angle for an option Still you argue for your cause Like you wouldn't know a burning Bush Till it blew up in your face We dream about the future We memorize the past When just a simple reaching out Could build a bridge that lasts And you ask ""What am I not doing?"" She says ""Your voice cannot command"" She says, ""In time you will move Mountains And it will come Through your hands."" So whatever your hands find to do You must do with all your heart There are thoughts enough to Blow men's minds And tear great worlds apart There's a healing touch to find you Out on that broad highway Somewhere Gonna lift you as high as music Running through an angel's hair And don't worry What you are not doing 'Cause your voice cannot command And in time you will move mountains And it will come through your hands Through your hands Through your hands"
Too Young to Die,"I recall my so called misspent youth It seems more worthwhile Every single day Cruisin' Van Nuys and acting so uncouth All the joys of runnin' away There was no speed limit On the Nevada state line The air was red wine On those top down nights Just you and me My old rollarskate And the common sense To know our rights Sweet old racin' car of mine Roarin' down that broken line I never been so much alive Too fast for comfort Too low to fly Too young to die You say a man can't love a material thing With aluminum skin And a cast iron soul But they never heard your engine sing Ah there's peace in losing control ""Sticky fingers"" turned up real loud Ah, we were flirtin' with catastrophe We were doing everything that's not allowed Life didn't come With a warranty For you and me Sweet old racin' car of mine Roarin' down that broken line I never been so much alive Too fast for comfort Too low to fly Too young to die There is peace in losing control When I die I don't wanna go to heaven I just wanna drive my beautiful machine Up north on some sonoma country road With Jimmy Dean and Steve McQueen All the boys be singin', singin' Sweet old racin' car of mine Roarin' down that broken line I never been so much alive Too fast for comfort Too low to fly Too young to die Just a little bit too young Too young To die"
Don't Be Denied,"When I was a young boy My mama said to me Your daddy's leaving home today I think he's gone to stay We packed up all our bags And drove out to Winnipeg When we got to Winnipeg I checked in to school I wore white bucks on my feet When I learned the golden rule The punches came fast and hard Lying on my back in the school yard Don't be denied, don't be denied Don't be denied, don't be denied Don't be denied, don't be denied Well pretty soon I met a friend He played guitar We used to sit on the steps at school And dream of being stars We started a band We played all night Oh no Don't be denied, don't be denied Don't be denied, don't be denied Don't be denied, don't be denied The businessmen crowded around They came to hear the golden sound There we were on the Sunset Strip Playing our songs for the highest bid We played all night The price was right Don't be denied, no don't be denied Don't be denied, don't be denied Don't be denied, don't be denied Well, all that glitters isn't gold I know you heard that story told And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise A millionaire through a businessman's eyes Oh friend of mine Don't be denied"
Journey Through the Past,Song without a home When the winter rains come pourin' down On that new home of mine Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine? Will your restless heart come back to mine On a journey through the past? Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind? Now I'm going back to Canada On a journey through the past And I won't be back 'til February comes I will stay with you if you'll stay with me Said the fiddler to the drum And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past When the winter rains come pourin' down On that new home of mine Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind? Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
L.A.,"In a matter of time, there'll be a friend of mine Gonna come to the coast, you're going to see him up close For a minute or two While the ground cracks under you By the look in your eyes, you'd think that it was a surprise But you seem to forget something somebody said About the bubbles in the sea And an ocean full of trees and you now L.A. uptight city in the smog, city in the smog Don't you wish that you could be here too? Don't you wish that you could be here too? Don't you wish that you could be here too? Well, it's hard to believe, so you get up to leave And you laugh at the door that you heard it all before Oh, it's so good to know That it's all just a show for you But when the suppers are bland and the freeways are crammed And the mountains erupt and the valley is sucked Into cracks in the earth Will I finally be heard by you? L.A. uptight city in the smog, city in the smog Don't you wish that you could be here too? Don't you wish that you could be here too? Don't you wish that you could be here too?"

You finally found a girl that makes you shine
And all you ever wanted was for her to be
By your side
I hope you take the time to understand me now
If I said some things you might not like to hear
But it's only me and how I feel about you
You are my friend
Watching over all the years I've known you now
You've been looking through the glass at shooting stars
And all you ever wanted was for them to see
Who they are, it's not ""so far""?
So forgive me if I ever disappointed you
And said some things you might not like to hear
But it's only me and how I feel about you
You are my friend"

Oh! Camil (The Winter Song),"Angela's Ashes A Memoir of a Childhood By Frank McCourt This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you. Acknowledgments This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women. R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers. Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me. Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road. And Molly was right. My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder. My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final page. I am blessed among men. I My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone. When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years. Above all-we were wet. Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve. It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest. From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages. The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles. Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the rain. My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head. When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar. Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced. After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital. My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth. After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder? Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder. He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out. Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house. She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia. Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him. My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse. My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases. St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes. Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year. And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway. Love her as in childhood Though feeble, old and grey. For you'll never miss a mother's love Till she's buried beneath the clay. At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare. She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons. With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler. A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it. That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself. Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps. Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble. Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland. Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin. Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family. Delia said, You shuddup. Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself. Och, I am, said Malachy. I am. Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap. And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan. Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little talk. Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass. Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians. Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian. You shuddup, said Delia. Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd manner. Malachy smiled. I do? about You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling. 'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena. Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going. Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know. There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy. You shuddup, said Delia. Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani. Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River. Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it. He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn. On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate. Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi. There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house. After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland. Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism. At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy. If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me? I am, Philomena. A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother. The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses. Their husbands agreed. I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw. Up, down, up, down. Malachy goes up. I get off. Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is on his mouth and there's blood. Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me. And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly slows her. She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed? In the middle of the day? She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off. My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside the child? did. our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth. Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood. I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the dog. Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All the same blood. Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature. Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child. Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die? It was his time, Francis. The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other room. My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap. Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo? Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin. I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep? Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway. That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall. He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap. For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes. Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on. In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother. I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing. When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world. She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening. I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl. I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam says, They get their appetites because they're starving half the time. When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me? When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun. When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry. When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had. All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad. Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you. But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me, From neither of them shall I part. For one is my mother, God bless her and love her, The other is my sweetheart. Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition. When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips. When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime? Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors? Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey. He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland. Deep in Canadian woods we met From one bright island flown. Great is the land we tread, but yet Our hearts are with our own. Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up. Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she I want them up, he says. I want them be free from the center to the sea. Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house. a penny in your pocket without says. ready for the day Ireland will do it'll be a sorry day in He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do? Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed. On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children. Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs? He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he says. Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She "
,
,
ells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains. We come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, Whaddya doin'
On the Line,"Hanging around is holding me down I'm starting to frown at everyone I see I'm taking the calls and playing the halls But staring at walls is all I ever see So is the money I make Worth the price that I pay?

Carry Me,"When I was a young man I found an old dream Was as battered and worn a one As you have ever seen  But I made it some new wings And I painted a nose And I wished so hard Up in the air I rose, singing  Carry me, carry me Carry me above the world Carry me, carry me, carry me  And I once loved a girl She was younger than me Her parents kept her locked up in their life She was crying at night She was wishing she could be free  'Course mostly I remember her laughing Standing there watching us play For a while there The music would take her away And she'd be singing  Carry me, carry me Carry me above this world Carry me, carry me, ooh Carry me above the world  And then there was my mother She was lying in white sheets there And she was waiting to die  She said if you'd just reach Underneath this bed And untie these weights I could surely fly  She's still smiling but she's tired She'd like to hear that last bell ring You know if she still could she would Stand up she could sing  Singing carry me, carry me Carry me above the world Carry me, carry me, carry me"
Cowboy Of Dreams,"Saw a sign on the highway I was driving along, way home On a hilltop is where I belong I took a look at the hole Where my head used to be And I'll sing you a song That descended on me  The way I live Determines the way My people survive Yes the way I live Determines the way My people survive  So I went to the country To look up a friend Cause I heard that the house And the barn had a blend I took a look at the hole Where the bird used to be And I'll sing him a song Because he sang one for me  The way I live Determines the way My people survive Yes the way I live Determines the way My people survive  And the names of the cowboys Will all blow away Like the dust off the desert On a hot windy day I've tried so hard to tell you In so many ways That I'm scared of the heartache and scenes With the cowboy of dreams"
Fieldworker,"Digging in your fields, pulling up your food No matter how I feel, don't do me no good ""Treat me like a human"" is all I got to say The man that I am working for won't let me get away  I came across your border just to work for you I give you all I got to give, what more can I do? Don't give me law and order, tell me to stick around While standing in the picket line, you try and shoot me down, down...  I come to your country to work on the land Watching the seeds as they die in the sand Fighting for your freedom with a hoe in your hand Fieldworker, fieldworker  Digging in your fields, I'm pulling up your food No matter how I feel, don't do me no good ""Treat me like a human"" is all I got to say The man that I am working for won't let me get away"
Homeward Through The Haze,"First rain of winter First fall from grace It's my first hollow echo In the halls of praise How could Samson I thought he was blind as a bat How cold he have torn down The temples like that And how could little Caesar How could he know whereof he spoke When all of his wheels are turning him into a joke  Cause the blind are leading the blind And I am amazed at how they stumble Homeward through the haze  Got the soul of a ragpicker Got the mind of a slug I keep sweeping problems Under my rug And all of my fine My fine fair weather friends, Yeah Will have no more time To make their amends  Cause the blind are leading the blind And I am amazed at how they stumble Homeward through the haze"
Love Work Out,Gotta make a love work out Before you get you got to give Gotta make a love work out Before you die you got to live If that's what it's all about Then there's nothing standing in my way I'm telling you all I've got to be on my way  I used to keep on trying from day to day To keep from dying and fading away It seems like a strange thing for me to say I'm so tired of looking the other way Love work out  You gotta make a love work out There's no use hiding behind the clouds You gotta make a love work out I dare you to scream it right out loud If that's what it's all about Then there's nothing standing in your way I'm telling you all you've got to be on your way  I used to keep on trying from day to day To keep from dying and fading away It seems like a strange thing for me to say I'm so tired of looking the other way So love work out
Low Down Payment,"There's one more thing I would like to say About what you do There's one more thing There might be one more way to do what you do You don't have anything Can there be anything Left for you to prove? You have already made your move Don't you even know who you are Star?  And I woke up this morning To the sound of a woman - a woman crying Crying for a roomful, a roomful of dreams Dreams dying You don't have to tell the truth Just as long as you can stand there and ignore the pain You've got a ticket to ride on this train By the way, you're gonna ride it alone Alone  It's a low down payment on this pillar Pillar of salt It's only had one owner, and he up and died He died of guilt And you can drive it out of here All you do is find a gear That will not blow it apart That's if you can even get it to start If the damn thing just had a heart If it had a heart â€” some kinda heart"
Mama Lion,"The horns in the fog could be heard if not seen Helping to guide the blind in a dream And down by the seashore, a banquet she gave She was feeding and needing a soul she could save  Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink Beneath the sunshine and the icicles In the things that you think There's a hole in my destiny And I'm out on the brink Mama lion, mama lion  She bounces off the boulders, she runs on the rocks She's taking her time from her grandfather clocks And over the border, and down on the land She's living in the future And it lies in her hand  Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink Beneath the sunshine and the icicles In the things that you think There's a hole in my destiny And I'm out on the brink Mama lion, mama lion  Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink Beneath the sunshine and the icicles In the things that you think There's a hole in my destiny And I'm out on the brink Mama lion, mama lion"
Naked In The Rain,"The clown sat speechless, looking in his mirror Unable to remember how to paint his face Staring at the image, slowly getting clearer Wondering if his fear or his heart would win the race  When it dawns on you What it takes from you Living under clouds of pain There's a storm in you You don't know what to do Just when you think you're going insane You lie naked in the rain  Fluttering pages of faces No two alike Choice is your soul's moment For its light to strike"
Take The Money And Run,Take the money and run Like a thief across a neighbor's yard Take the money and run Like a ghost out in the night Take the money and run 'cause you found out that it wasn't hard To take the money and run Because you were out of sight You cannot tell me any more lies You cannot pull the wool over my eyes Take the money and run  Take the money and run 'cause the summer sun is sinking down Take the money and run 'cause the four winds may not blow Take the money and run 'cause the verdict has been handed down Take the money and run Because there's no place left to go You cannot give me any more time You've already taken too much of mine Take the money and run  Take the money and run Like a thief across a neighbor's yard Take the money and run Like a dog out in the night Take the money and run Because you found out that it wasn't hard To take the money and run Because you were out of sight You cannot give me any more time You've already taken too much of mine Take the money and run
