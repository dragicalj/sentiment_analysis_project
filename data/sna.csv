I Like You,"(Look out for yourself)

I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground

I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall
As you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called

I stack it in my mind
And I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like
To be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
(Huh)

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y

[JID:]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape
Thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic, quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

Everybody wants to be

Canâ€™t Catch Me Now - from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,"There's blood on the side of the mountain
There's writing all over the wall
Shadows of us are still dancin'
In every room and every hall
There's snow fallin' over the city
You thought that it would wash away
The bitter taste of my fury
And all of the messes you made
Yeah, you think that you got away

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Bet you thought I'd never do it
Thought it'd go over my head
I bet you figured I'd pass with the winter
Be somethin' easy to forget
Oh, you think I'm gone 'cause I left

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town

Pot start to bubble, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bustdown everything, set in rose gold
