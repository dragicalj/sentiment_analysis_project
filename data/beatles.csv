Eleanor Rigby,"Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been,
Lives in a dream.
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door.
Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon
That no-one will hear,
No-one comes near.
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there.
What does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name.
Nobody came.
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave.
No-one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people."
Penny Lane,"Penny Lane there in a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say ""Hello"".
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway.
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
>From the pouring rain - very strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies...
Penny Lane!"
All You Need Is Love,"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.

Fool On The Hill,"Day after day, alone on a hill,
The man with a foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud.
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.
And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.
Oh, 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round.
And he never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools.
They don't like him.
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.
Oh, 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and..."

Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.
See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.
Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didn't come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet."

Hey Jude,"Hey Jude don't make it bad,
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude don't be afraid,
You were made to go out and get her.

Let It Be,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness she is standing
Right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be.

Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

That shines on me.

Something,"Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover.
Something in the way she woos me.

That I don't need no other lover.
Something in her style that shows me.
Don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.
You're asking me will my love grow,
I don't know, I don't know.
You stick around now it may show,
I don't know, I don't know.

And all I have to do is think of her.

The Long And Winding Road,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before,
It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears,
Crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way.
Many times I've been alone,
And many times cried.
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried.
And still they lead me back
To the long winding road.
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago.
Don't leave me waiting here,
Lead me to your door.
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road.
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago.
Don't keep me waiting here,
(Don't keep me waiting.)
Lead me to your door."

If I Fell,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true,
And help me understand?
'Cos I've been in love before,
And I found that that love was more
Than just holding hands.
If I give my heart to you,
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her.
If I trust in you, oh please,
Don't run and hide.
If I love you too, oh please,
Don't hurt my pride like her.
'Cos I couldn't stand the pain,
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain.
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you,
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two.

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da.

Tell Me What You See,"If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if I'm part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.

Yes It Is,"If you wear red tonight,
Remember what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that my baby wore,
And what is more, it's true,
Yes it is.
Scarlet were the clothes she wore,
Everybody knows I've sure.
I would remember all the things we planned,
Understand, it's true,
Yes it is, it's true.

You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,"Here I stand, head in hand,
Turn my face to the wall.
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small.
Everywhere people stare,
Each and every day.
I can see them laugh at me,
And I hear them say:
""Hey, you've got to hide your love away""
""Hey, you've got to hide your love away""
How can I even try?
I can never win,
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in.
How could she say to me,
""Love will find a way""?
Gather 'round all you clowns,
Let me hear you say:
""Hey, you've got to hide your love away""
""Hey, you've got to hide your love away"""
Another Girl,"For I hove found another girl, another girl.
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you,
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,
For I have got another girl, another girl.
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few.
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do.
And so I'm telling you, ""This time you'd better stop.""
For I have got another girl. Another girl.
Who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend.

Yesterday,"Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go, I don't know,
She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

I need to make you see,
Oh what you mean to me.
Until I do I'm hoping you
Will know what I mean.
I love you.
I want you, I want you, I want you,
I think you know by now.
I'll get to you somehow.
Until I do I'm telling you
So you'll understand.

In My Life,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed.
Some forever, not for better.
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places had their moments,
With lovers and friends I still can recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I loved them all.
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you.
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before.
I know I'll often stop and think about them.
In my life I'll love you more.
Though I know I'll never lose affection

In my life I'll love you more.

Girl,"Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry,
Still you don't regret a single day.
Ah, girl. Girl, girl.
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her.
She will turn to me and start to cry,
And she promises the earth to me, and I believe her.
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, girl. Girl, girl.
She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Girl. Girl, girl.
Was she told when she was young that fame would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl. Girl, girl.
Ah, girl. Girl, girl."
Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed"".
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown.
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood."
For No One,"You're day breaks, you're mind aches.
You find that all her words of kindness
Linger on when she no longer needs you.
She wakes up, she makes up,
She takes her time and doesn't feel
She has to hurry. She no longer needs you.
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
I love that should have lasted years.
You want her, you need her,
And yet you don't believe her when she says
""Our love is dead"". You think she needs you.
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
I love that should have lasted years.
You stay home, she goes out.
She says that long ago she knew someone,
But now he's gone. She doesn't need him.
You're day breaks, you're mind aches.
There will times when all the things she said
Will fill you're head. You won't forget her.
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
I love that should have lasted years."
"Here, There And Everywhere","To lead a better life, I need my love to be here.
Here, making each day of the year.
Changing my life with a wave of her hand.
Nobody can deny that there's something there.
There, running my hands through her hair,
Both of thinking how good it can be.
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there.
I want her everywhere, and if she's beside me
I know I need never care.
But to love her is to need her everywhere,
Knowing that love is to share.
Each one believing that love never dies,
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there.

She's Leaving Home,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins.
Silently closing her bedroom door,
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more,
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief.
Quietly turning the backdoor key,
Stepping outside she is free.
She                (We gave her most of our lives,)
Is leaving         (Sacrificed most of our lives.)
Home.              (We gave her everything money could buy.)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. (Bye, bye.)
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown.
Picks up the letter that's lying there.
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband:
""Daddy, our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could sho do this to me?""
She                (We never thought of ourselves,)
Is leaving         (Never a thought for ourselves.)
Home.              (We struggled hard all our lives to get by.)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. (Bye, bye.)
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made,
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She                (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having          (We didn't know it was wrong.)
Fun.               (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy.)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. (Bye, bye.)
She's leaving home, bye, bye."
Good Night,"Now it's time to say good night.

With A Little Help From My Friends,"What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends,
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends."
When I'm 64,"When I get older, losing my hair,
many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine,
Birthday greetings bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too,
And if you say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside,
Sunday mornings go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear.
We shall scrimp and save. (We shall scrimp and save.)
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave.
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say.
Yours sincerely, wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form.
Mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?"

Honey Pie,"She was a working girl
North of England way.
Now she's hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say:
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy,
I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home?
Oh, Honey Pie my position is tragic.
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song.
You became a legend of the silver screen,
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.
Ah, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic.
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.
Honey Pie come back to me.
Yeah.
I like it like that, ooh.
I like this kinda, hot kinda music.
Hot kind of music.
Play it to me,
Play it to me Hollywood Blues.
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing
Back to me.
Now, Honey Pie, you are making me crazy,
I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me Honey Pie.
Honey Pie, Honey Pie."
Across The Universe,"Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup.
They slither while they pass,
They slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guri dev a om.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me
On and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander
Like a restless wind inside a letterbox,
They tumnble blindly as they make
Their way across the universe.
Jai guri dev a om.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Sounds of laughter, shades of earth
Are ringing through my open views,
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me
On and on across the universe
Jai guri dev a om.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Jai guri dev a.
Jai guri dev a.

While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps.
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping,
Still me guitar gently weeps.
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love.
I don't know how someone controlled you,
They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps.
With every mistake we must surely be learning,
Still my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know how you were diverted.
You were perverted too.
I don't know how you were inverted.
No one alerted you.
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps.
I look at you all...
Still my guitar gently weeps."
Back In The U.S.S.R.,"Oh, flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C.
Didn't get to bed last night.
On the way the paper bag was on my knee,
Man I had a dreadful flight.
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the U.S.S.R.
Been away so long I hardly knew the place,
Gee it's good to be back home.
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case,
Honey disconnect the phone.
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the U.S., back in the U.S., back in the U.S.S.R.
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out,
They leave the west behind.
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind.
Oh come on!
Yeh, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boys,
Back in the U.S.S.R.
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out,
They leave the west behind.
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind.
Oh, show me 'round your snowy peaked mountains way down south,
Take me to your daddy's farm.
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out,
Come and keep your comrade warm.
I'm back in the U.S.S.R., hey.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the U.S.S.R.
Ah, let me tell you honey.
Yeah, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
Very soon I'm gonna be back in the U.S.S.R."
Revolution,"You say you want a revolution,
Well you know
We all want to change the world.
You tell me that it's evolution,
Well you know
We all want to change the world.
But when you talk about destruction,
Don't you know that you can count me out?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright,
Alright, alright?
You say you got a real solution,
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan.
You ask me for a contribution,
Well you know
We're all doing what we can.
But if you want money for people with minds that hate,
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait.
Don't you know it's gonna be alright,
Alright, alright?
You say you'll change the constitution,
Well you know
We all want to change your head.
You tell me it's the institution,
Well you know
You better free your mind instead.
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao,
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow.
Don't you know it's gonna be alright,
Alright, alright?
Alright, alright, alright, alright,
Alright, alright, alright, alright."
Rain,"If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everything's the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
It's just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Everybody's laughing,
Everybody's happy.

Mean Mr. Mustard,"Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park,
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper.
Sleeps in a hole in the road.
Saving up to buy some clothes.
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose.
Such a mean old man.
Such a mean old man.
His sister Pam works in a shop,
She never stops, she's a go-getter.
Takes him out to look at the queen,
Only place that he's ever been.
Always shouts out something obscene.
Such a dirty old man.
Dirty old man."
Polythene Pam,"Well, you should see Polythene Pam.
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man.
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag.
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt.
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt.
She's the kind of a girl that makes the ""News of the World"".
Yes, you could say she was attractively built.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Year.
Great."
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window,"Fellas come on now.
Oh, look out!
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon.
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon.
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me.
She said she'd always been a dancer,
She worked at fifteen clubs a day.
And though she thought I knew the answer,
Well, I knew what I could not say.
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job.
And though she tried her best to help me,
She could steal but she could not rob.
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me.
Oh yeah."
Golden Slumbers,"Once there was a way to get back homeward.
Once there was a way to get back home.
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye.
Golden slumbers fill your eyes.
Smiles awake you when you rise.
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye.
Once there was a way to get back homeward.
Once there was a way to get back home.
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye."
Carry That Weight,"Boy, you're going to carry that weight,
Carry that weight a long time.
Boy, you're going to carry that weight,
Carry that weight a long time.
I never give you my pillow.
I only send you my invitations,
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down.
Boy, you're going to carry that weight,
Carry that weight a long time.
Boy, you're going to carry that weight,
Carry that weight a long time."
The End,"Oh yeah, alright.
Are you going to be in my dreams tonight?
(Love you, love you, love you...)
And in the end the love you take
Is equal to the love you make."
A Day In The Life,"I read the news today, oh boy,
About a lucky man who made the grade.
And though the news was rather sad,
Well I just had to laugh.
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car,
He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
A crowd of people stood and stared,
They'd seen his face before.
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.
I saw a film today, oh boy.
The English army had just won the war.
A crowd of people turned away,
But I just had to look,
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on.
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13...)
Woke up, fell out of bed,
(1)
Dragged a comb across my head.
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat,
Made the bus in seconds flat. (Morning.)
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke, and I went into a dream.
I read the news today, oh boy.
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire.
And though the holes were rather small,
They had to count them all.
Now they know how many holes
It takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on.
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13...)"
Nobody I Know,"Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to th tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams
I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.
Even in my dreams
I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to th tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me."
Don't Let Me Down,"Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Nobody ever loved me like she does,
Oo, she dies, yeah, she does.
And if somebody loved me like she do me,
Oo, she do me, yes, she does.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
I'm in love for the first time.
Don't you know it's gonna last.
It's a love that lasts forever,
It's a love that had no past.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
And from the first time that she really done me,
Oo, she done me, she done me good.
I guess nobody ever really done me,
Oo, she done me, she done me good.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down."
The Ballad Of John And Yoko,"Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, ""You've got to turn back"".
You know they didn't even give us a chance.
Christ you know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
""You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"".
Christ you know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, ""Say what you doing in bed?""
I said, ""We're only trying to get us some peace"".
Christ you know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
""Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!""
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, ""She's gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag"".
Christ you know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, ""We wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back"".
Christ you know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me."
Old Brown Shoe,"I want a love that's right, but right is only half of what's wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now I'm sleeping out this old brown shoe. Baby, I'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you.
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down,
And when I see your smile replacing every thoughtless frown,
Got me escaping from this zoo. Baby, I'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you.
If I grow up I'll be a singer, wearing rings on every finger,
Not worrying what they or you say, I'll live and love and maybe some day
Who knows baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject.
I'm changing faster than the weather. If you and me should get together,
Who knows baby, you may comfort me.
That love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate.
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not too late,
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue. Baby, I'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, when I'm with you.
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, when I'm with you."
I Will,"Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still.
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to - I will.
For if I ever saw you,
I didn't catch your name.
But it never really mattered,
I will always feel the same.
Love you forever and forever.
Love you with all my heart.
Love you whenever we're together.
Love you when we're apart.
And when at last I find you,
Your song will fill the air.
Sing it loud so I can hear you,
Make it easy to be near you,
For the things you do endear you to me.
You know I will. I will."
Blackbird,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free.
Blackbird fly. Blackbird fly.
Into the light of the dark black night.
Blackbird fly. Blackbird fly.
Into the light of the dark black night.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise."

I'm Looking Through You,"I am looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?
You don't look different
But You have changed
I am looking through you
You are not the same

Your lips are moving,
I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound different
I have learned the game
I am looking through you
You are the same

Why tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has the nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You are thinking of me 
The same old way
You were above me
But not today
The only difference is 
You are down there
I am looking through you 
And I don't know where?

Why tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?

What Goes On,"What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
When I saw him with you, 
I could feel my future fold
Its so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why...

What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes in your mind

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
Now that tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
Its so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why...
What goes on in your heart

I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why...

What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind"

Maxwell's Silver Hammer,"Joan was quizzical, 
Studied meta physical 
Science in her home
Late nights all alone with the test tubes
Oh o-o-oh
Maxwell Eddison
Majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures
Jo-o-oan
As she is getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door
Bang-bang
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Bang-bang
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleseant 
Sc-e-e-e-en!

She tells Max to stay 
When the class is gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times, I must not be 
So-o-o-oh!
When she turns the back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang-bang
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Tu-ru-to-ro
Bang-bang
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

PC thirty one
Said we caught a dirty one
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh-o-o-oh!
Rose and Valerie
Screeming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
Judge does not agree
And he tells them 
So-o-o-oh!
As the words are leaving his lips
A voice comes from behind
(hauling)

Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

I Need You,"You don't realize, 
How Much I Need You
Love you all the time, 
And never leave you
Please come on back to me,
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you wouldn't upset me
I didn't realize,
As I looked into your eyes
You told me
Oh Yes! You told me 
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
I'm feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember,
How I feel about you
I can never really live without you
So come-on back and see,
Just what you mean to me
I need you!

But when you told me
You don't want my love any more
That's when it hurt me
I'm feeling like this,
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember,
How I feel about you
I can never really live without you
So come-on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you"
